# Validation Summary for Risk Scoring

## Content Metrics
- Lines of content: 643 (minimum: 50) ✓
- Level-2 headings: 26 (minimum: 3) ✓
- Code examples: 18 (minimum: 2) ✓
- Source references: 20+ (minimum: 1) ✓

## Drift Issues Resolved
- Critical: 0/0 ✓
- High: 0/0 ✓
- Medium: 5/5 ✓
  1. Dynamic weight adjustment based on coverage availability
  2. Role multipliers updated to actual FunctionRole enum
  3. Role classification detection heuristics added
  4. Coverage propagation implementation details added
  5. ROI calculation enhanced formula documented
- Low: 4/4 ✓
  1. Unified score example corrected
  2. Test effort assessment model explained
  3. Legacy debt_score source clarified
  4. Risk distribution field mapping table added

## Code Validation
- All struct fields verified: ✓ (UnifiedScore, UnifiedDebtItem, FunctionRole, etc.)
- All enum variants verified: ✓ (FunctionRole, RiskCategory)
- All formulas verified: ✓ (scoring formulas match src/priority/scoring/calculation.rs)
- All examples have source attribution: ✓ (20+ source references)
- All referenced files exist: ✓ (all paths validated)

## Quality Gates
✓ Meets minimum content requirements (643 lines vs 50 minimum)
✓ All critical issues resolved (0 critical issues)
✓ All high severity issues resolved (0 high issues)
✓ All medium severity issues resolved (5/5)
✓ All low severity issues resolved (4/4)
✓ All examples grounded in codebase
✓ All source references validated

## Key Improvements
1. Added dynamic weight adjustment explanation (coverage vs no-coverage scenarios)
2. Updated role table with actual FunctionRole enum (7 roles instead of 6 generic ones)
3. Documented PureLogic dynamic multiplier (1.0 vs 1.3 based on complexity)
4. Added role detection heuristics with line number references
5. Expanded coverage propagation with distance-based dampening formulas
6. Enhanced ROI calculation with all 6 components explained
7. Corrected unified score example to match actual implementation
8. Added legacy vs unified risk distribution field comparison table
9. Explained test effort model (cyclomatic for test count, cognitive for hours)
10. Clarified debt_score source (DebtAggregator)

## Subsection Scope
- Feature mappings: (empty - general risk scoring concepts)
- Cross-references preserved: complexity-metrics, debt-patterns, interpreting-results
- No duplication with other subsections
- Fits within Analysis Guide chapter context

Status: READY TO COMMIT
