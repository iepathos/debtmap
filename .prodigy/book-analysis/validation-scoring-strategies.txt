# Validation Summary for Scoring Strategies

## Content Metrics
- Lines of content: 1574 (minimum: 100) ✓
- Headings: 45+ (minimum: 5) ✓
- Code examples: 50+ (minimum: 3) ✓
- Source references: Multiple CLI and config references ✓

## Drift Issues Resolved
- Critical: 0/0 ✓
- High: 0/0 ✓
- Medium: 1/1 ✓ (Broken links fixed)
- Low: 4/4 ✓ (All outdated/incomplete content updated)

## Link Validation
- All internal links verified against actual files
- All referenced files exist:
  ✓ book/src/configuration.md
  ✓ book/src/analysis-guide/index.md
  ✓ ARCHITECTURE.md

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Broken Links (Medium Severity)
- Removed references to non-existent files:
  - migration-guide.md (removed from See Also)
  - file-classification.md (removed from See Also)
  - tiered-prioritization.md (removed from See Also)
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md link path: ../ARCHITECTURE.md → ../../ARCHITECTURE.md
- Updated analysis-guide.md link: ./analysis-guide.md → ./analysis-guide/index.md

### 2. Clarified CLI Flag Syntax (Low Severity)
- Line 84: Updated --aggregate-only documentation
- Before: "a boolean flag—no value needed"
- After: "no argument required: use `debtmap analyze . --aggregate-only`"
- Provides exact CLI usage example

### 3. Added Config Filename Explanation (Low Severity)
- Line 199: Expanded .debtmap.toml explanation
- Added: "Debtmap searches for `.debtmap.toml` in the current directory, or you can specify an alternate path with `--config path/to/config.toml`."
- Clarifies search behavior and --config flag usage

### 4. Documented Aggregation Method CLI Flag (Low Severity)
- Line 125: Clarified "Or via configuration" → "Or via configuration file"
- CLI flag --aggregation-method already documented at line 122
- Issue was minor wording clarity, now resolved

### 5. Clarified Rebalanced Scoring Activation (Low Severity)
- Line 986: Simplified activation explanation
- Line 1236: Removed incorrect --legacy-scoring flag reference
- Added note: "There is no `--legacy-scoring` CLI flag. Switch between algorithms by modifying your configuration file"
- Updated migration steps to reflect config-only approach

## Code Validation
- All CLI flags verified against src/cli.rs:
  ✓ --aggregate-only (line 184)
  ✓ --aggregation-method (line 192)
  ✓ --config (global flag, line 45)
- No --legacy-scoring flag exists (correctly removed from docs)

## Quality Gates
✓ Meets minimum content requirements (1574 lines >> 100)
✓ All critical issues resolved (0 issues)
✓ All high severity issues resolved (0 issues)
✓ All medium severity issues resolved (1/1 fixed)
✓ All low severity issues resolved (4/4 fixed)
✓ All links point to valid files
✓ All CLI flags verified against source code
✓ All formulas and examples retained from positive aspects
