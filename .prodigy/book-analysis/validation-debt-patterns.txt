## Code Validation
- All struct fields verified: ✓ (DebtType variants match src/priority/mod.rs:158-288)
- All category mappings verified: ✓ (src/priority/mod.rs:309-347)
- All examples have source attribution: ✓ (10 source references)
- All referenced files exist: ✓

## Key Updates
1. Updated debt type count from 25 to 27
2. Added three missing type organization patterns:
   - ScatteredType (types with scattered methods)
   - OrphanedFunctions (functions that should be methods)
   - UtilitiesSprawl (utility modules with poor cohesion)
3. Corrected category mappings:
   - Moved ComplexityHotspot to CodeQuality
   - Moved DeadCode to CodeQuality
   - Moved MagicValues to CodeQuality
   - Added ScatteredType, OrphanedFunctions, UtilitiesSprawl to Architecture
4. Reorganized examples to match actual category mappings
5. Added note about DebtType variants carrying structured diagnostic data
6. Added comprehensive examples with detection criteria for new patterns
