# Validation Summary for Boilerplate Detection

## Content Metrics
- Lines of content: 256 (minimum: 100 for chapter)
- Headings: 10 level-2 headings (minimum: 5)
- Code examples: 8 code blocks (minimum: 3)
- Source references: 11 source file references (minimum: 2)

## Drift Issues Resolved
- Critical: 0/0
- High: 1/1 (Incorrect CLI flags removed and replaced with accurate usage)
- Medium: 6/6 (All configuration, scoring, pattern type, and integration issues fixed)
- Low: 3/3 (All detection signals, god object integration, and default value issues fixed)

Total: 10/10 issues resolved

## Code Validation
- All struct fields verified: ✓ (BoilerplateDetectionConfig matches src/organization/boilerplate_detector.rs:256-322)
- All enum variants verified: ✓ (BoilerplatePattern matches src/organization/boilerplate_detector.rs:228-243)
- All examples have source attribution: ✓ (All examples reference source files or tests)
- All referenced files exist: ✓ (Verified all src/ and tests/ references)
- CLI syntax verified: ✓ (No boilerplate CLI flags exist, documented config-only approach)
- Default values match: ✓ (All defaults verified against Default impl at lines 48-57, 310-322)

## Quality Gates
✓ Meets minimum content requirements (256 lines >> 100 minimum)
✓ All critical issues resolved (0 critical issues)
✓ All high severity issues resolved (1/1 fixed - CLI flags)
✓ All medium severity issues resolved (6/6 fixed)
✓ All low severity issues resolved (3/3 fixed)
✓ All examples grounded in codebase
✓ All source references validated
✓ All internal links validated (god-object-detection.md, design-patterns.md, boilerplate-vs-complexity.md, configuration.md)

## New Content Added
- Detection Signals section documenting DetectionSignal enum
- Boilerplate Scoring Algorithm with detailed weighted calculation
- Test Boilerplate pattern type (was missing)
- Integration with God Object Detection section
- Corrected configuration with all 8 fields
- Real examples from test files with source attribution
- Macro Recommendations section with output examples
- Removed incorrect CLI flags, replaced with accurate config-only usage

Status: READY TO COMMIT
