  "issues": [],
  "positive_aspects": [
    "Comprehensive coverage of LCOV format and its universal compatibility across languages",
    "Accurate documentation of scoring modes: dampening multiplier (with coverage) vs weighted sum (without coverage)",
    "Correct implementation references with specific line numbers: src/priority/scoring/calculation.rs:68-82 (dampening), :119-129 (fallback)",
    "Detailed transitive coverage propagation algorithm correctly documented with exact parameters: 80% well-tested threshold, 70% distance discount per hop, 3 hops maximum distance",
    "Performance characteristics accurately documented: O(1) exact lookup (~0.5μs), O(files) fallback (~5-8μs), ~200 bytes per record memory usage",
    "Algorithm parameters correctly documented in 'Algorithm Parameters' section (lines 195-202) matching src/priority/coverage_propagation.rs:38-46",
    "Complete language-specific examples for Rust (cargo-tarpaulin), JavaScript/TypeScript (Jest), Python (pytest-cov), and Go (go test)",
    "Thorough troubleshooting section with practical solutions for common issues",
    "Best practices clearly organized by workflow, testing strategy, configuration, and CI integration",
    "All internal cross-references validated and functional (scoring-strategies.md, cli-reference.md, troubleshooting.md, tiered-prioritization.md, configuration.md)",
    "CLI options accurately documented: --coverage-file with --lcov alias, properly documented in src/cli.rs",
    "Clear explanation of coverage dampening formula: Final Score = Base Score × (1.0 - coverage_pct)",
    "Accurate test function handling: coverage multiplier = 0.0 for test functions (lines 172-173)",
    "Well-documented coverage index structure with nested HashMap approach (lines 226-238)",
    "Correct explanation of fallback lookup strategies: suffix matching, reverse suffix matching, normalized equality (lines 230-233)",
    "Implementation note correctly states weights are deprecated and explains current spec 122 behavior (lines 446-447)",
    "Well-structured FAQ section addressing common user questions with practical answers",
    "Accurate scoring invariant documented: 'Total debt score with coverage ≤ total debt score without coverage' (line 175)",
    "Entry point handling correctly explained via semantic classification system with role multipliers (lines 173-174, 424)",
    "Coverage index performance implementation reference correctly points to src/risk/coverage_index.rs:13-38 (line 239)"
  ],
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Consider adding a visual diagram showing the coverage dampening effect on scores at different coverage levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)",
    "Could add a section on coverage data quality and how to verify LCOV file integrity (checksums, record counts)",
    "Might benefit from a comparison table showing when to use coverage-aware vs coverage-agnostic analysis",
    "Consider adding examples of integrating with coverage tools for additional languages (C++, Ruby, Java)",
    "Could include example output showing verbose logging (-vv) to help users debug coverage correlation issues",
    "Consider adding a 'Quick Start' section at the beginning for users who want immediate setup",
    "Could document which LCOV metrics are used (line coverage vs branch coverage) and how they're interpreted",
    "Might add section on coverage correlation warnings and expected correlation percentages for healthy projects"
