While introductions shouldn't be exhaustive, some major differentiating features could be mentioned.",

  "positive_aspects": [
    "Clear and compelling positioning as an 'AI sensor' rather than prescriber - this differentiation is well articulated",

    "Practical quick tip at the end ('Start with debtmap analyze . --format markdown --top 5') guides new users",

    "Reconcile 'Rust-only' statement with features inventory showing Python support - clarify current state",

    "Consider mentioning the TUI guide for interactive exploration as an alternative to CLI piping",
    "Add brief note about validate command for CI/CD gates since it's mentioned but not linked"
