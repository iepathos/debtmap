- High: 0/0
- Medium: 5/5 ✓
  - Fixed JS/TS async error detection claims
  - Added prominent implementation status callout
  - Updated language support comparison table

## Code Validation
- All struct fields verified: ✓ (ErrorHandlingConfig, ErrorPatternConfig, SeverityOverride)
- All source references validated: ✓
  - src/config/detection.rs:275-374
  - src/debt/async_errors.rs
  - src/debt/python_error_handling.rs
  - src/analyzers/javascript/detectors/testing/
  - src/debt/error_swallowing.rs:12
  - src/debt/panic_patterns.rs:12
- All examples grounded in codebase: ✓
- All internal links validated: ✓ (6 links, all valid)

## Major Updates
1. JavaScript/TypeScript implementation status now clearly documented as LIMITED
2. Prominent callout boxes explain what IS vs IS NOT implemented
3. Language support table updated to reflect actual implementation (NOT IMPLEMENTED for JS/TS error swallowing)
4. Added 100+ lines documenting custom_patterns and severity_overrides configuration
5. Added comprehensive Test Code Detection section (180+ lines) covering Rust, Python, JS/TS
6. Added troubleshooting entry for JS/TS error detection with honest answer and ESLint workarounds
7. All planned JS/TS features now labeled as "Planned Feature" with callout boxes

## Quality Gates
✓ Meets minimum content requirements (1411 lines)
✓ All medium severity drift issues resolved (5/5)
✓ All examples grounded in codebase
✓ All source references validated
✓ All internal links valid
✓ No broken cross-references

Status: READY TO COMMIT
