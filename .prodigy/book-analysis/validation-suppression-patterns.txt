✓ All high severity issues resolved (none existed)
✓ All examples grounded in codebase
✓ All source references validated
✓ Comprehensive coverage of all topics
✓ Clear structure and organization
✓ Practical, working examples

## Positive Aspects (from drift analysis)
- Complete coverage of all four inline suppression formats
- Accurate type-specific suppression with correct bracket syntax
- Comprehensive table showing debt type support
- Clear explanation of why auto-detected types cannot use bracket notation
- Excellent examples in multiple languages
- Correct language-specific comment syntax documentation
- Accurate glob pattern syntax
- Transparent about limitations (function-level exclusions)
- Honest about suppression statistics (not exposed in output)
- Comprehensive best practices and troubleshooting sections
- All internal links validated

## Improvement Suggestions (Optional)
The drift analysis suggests 6 optional enhancements for developer-focused content:
1. Advanced section on functional programming patterns
2. Mention SuppressionContext::get_stats() for tool developers
3. Forward-looking note about --show-suppression-stats flag
4. Developer note about extending DEBT_TYPE_MAP
5. Special line 0 handling for AST edge cases
6. Cross-reference to testing patterns chapter

These are enhancements for future consideration, not required fixes.

Status: EXCELLENT - NO FIXES REQUIRED
