  "severity": "low",
  "quality_assessment": "Documentation is comprehensive and accurate. All internal links are valid. Configuration parameters are correctly documented with proper reference to source code. Algorithm explanation matches implementation. The hardcoded vs configurable threshold distinction is now properly documented.",
  "issues": [],
  "positive_aspects": [
    "Excellent explanation of Shannon entropy formula with correct mathematical notation",
    "Clear language-agnostic examples showing same pattern across Rust, Python, TypeScript",
    "Accurate documentation of graduated dampening formula matching implementation (src/complexity/entropy.rs:179-195)",
    "Correct documentation of all configurable parameters with accurate defaults",
    "Good examples showing effective complexity calculations with step-by-step math",
    "Historical context provided for Spec 68 and evolution of algorithm",
    "Comprehensive configuration tuning examples (strict, lenient, disabled modes)",
    "Clear output format explanation showing how to interpret entropy-adjusted results",
    "Practical 'Verifying Correctness' section with commands to test entropy impact",
    "All internal links are now valid (why-debtmap.md, analysis-guide/index.md, configuration.md)",
    "Properly documents the entropy_threshold config field behavior - notes it exists in struct but 0.4 value is hardcoded in dampening calculation (src/complexity/entropy.rs:192)",
    "Accurate token classification weight documentation (high: 1.0, medium: 0.7, low: 0.3)",
    "Correct minimum floor documentation (70% of original complexity preserved)"
  ],
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Consider adding a 'Quick Reference' table mapping config parameters to their effects",
    "Consider adding cross-reference to complexity-metrics.md which also discusses entropy concepts",
    "Consider adding troubleshooting entry for 'entropy dampening seems too aggressive/conservative'",
    "Could add example of how token classification affects entropy scores in practice",
    "Could clarify relationship between apply_entropy_dampening (spec 68 simple algorithm at line 1017) and compute_dampening_factor (sophisticated three-factor algorithm at line 179)"
