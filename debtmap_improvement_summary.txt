Debtmap Improvement Summary
===========================

BEFORE:
- Total debt score: 3597
- Critical risk functions: 314
- Top testing priority: default() function with ROI 10

AFTER:
- Total debt score: 3615 (+18, slight increase due to new test files)
- Critical risk functions: 296 (-18, reduced by 5.7%)
- Top testing priority: Still default() but now tested

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Critical risk functions reduced from 314 to 296 (18 functions improved)
2. Added comprehensive test coverage for high-ROI functions:
   - ContextAggregator::default() and ContextMap::default()
   - ResultExt::map_err_context()
   - AST extraction methods (extract_nodes behavior)

3. New test files created:
   - tests/risk_context_tests.rs (15 tests)
   - tests/core_monadic_tests.rs (16 tests)  
   - tests/core_ast_tests.rs (16 tests)

4. Total new test cases added: 47 tests

IMPACT:
- Reduced critical risk by covering core infrastructure functions
- Improved test coverage for functions with high cascade impact
- Foundation laid for better test coverage in critical modules
