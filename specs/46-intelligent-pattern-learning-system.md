# Specification 46: Intelligent Pattern Learning System

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [43, 44, 45]

## Context

While rule-based detection works for known patterns, many framework-specific idioms and project conventions are missed, leading to false positives. The system needs intelligence to:
- Learn from user feedback about false positives
- Recognize project-specific patterns and conventions
- Adapt to different frameworks and coding styles
- Improve accuracy over time

A learning system would enable debtmap to become more accurate for each specific codebase it analyzes, reducing noise and improving developer trust.

## Objective

Implement an intelligent pattern learning system that adapts to project-specific conventions, learns from user feedback, recognizes framework idioms automatically, and improves detection accuracy over time through machine learning techniques while maintaining explainability and user control.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Pattern Learning from Feedback**
   - Learn from suppression comments as negative examples
   - Track user-accepted vs user-rejected recommendations
   - Build project-specific pattern database
   - Share learnings across similar projects (opt-in)

2. **Framework Pattern Recognition**
   - Automatically detect framework usage (React, Angular, Express, etc.)
   - Load framework-specific pattern libraries
   - Recognize framework conventions and best practices
   - Adapt rules based on framework version

3. **Semantic Understanding**
   - Analyze function and variable names for intent
   - Recognize common naming patterns (get*, set*, handle*, etc.)
   - Understand domain-specific terminology
   - Infer function purpose from context

4. **Adaptive Thresholds**
   - Learn appropriate complexity thresholds per project
   - Adjust sensitivity based on codebase characteristics
   - Recognize "normal" vs "abnormal" for each project
   - Statistical anomaly detection

5. **Pattern Discovery**
   - Identify recurring code patterns automatically
   - Cluster similar functions by structure
   - Detect project-specific conventions
   - Find correlation between patterns and bugs

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Explainability**
   - All decisions must be explainable
   - Show confidence levels for learned patterns
   - Provide reasoning for adaptations
   - Allow user override of learned rules

2. **Privacy**
   - Local learning by default
   - Opt-in sharing of patterns
   - No code transmission without consent
   - Anonymized pattern sharing only

3. **Performance**
   - Learning should be incremental
   - Model updates in background
   - Minimal impact on analysis speed
   - Efficient pattern matching

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System learns from suppression comments automatically
- [ ] Framework detection works for top 10 frameworks
- [ ] False positive rate decreases by 30% after learning
- [ ] Pattern confidence scores are displayed
- [ ] User can review and modify learned patterns

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Learning Pipeline**
   ```rust
   pub struct PatternLearner {
       local_model: LocalModel,
       pattern_database: PatternDB,
       feedback_collector: FeedbackCollector,
       framework_detector: FrameworkDetector,
   }
   
   impl PatternLearner {
       pub fn learn_from_suppression(
           &mut self,
           suppression: &Suppression,
           context: &CodeContext,
       ) {
           // Extract features from suppressed code
           let features = self.extract_features(context);
           
           // Update model with negative example
           self.local_model.add_negative_example(features);
           
           // Store pattern for future reference
           self.pattern_database.store_exception(
               suppression.pattern_type,
               features,
               suppression.reason,
           );
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Framework Detection**
   ```rust
   pub struct FrameworkDetector {
       signatures: HashMap<Framework, FrameworkSignature>,
       confidence_threshold: f64,
   }
   
   impl FrameworkDetector {
       pub fn detect_frameworks(&self, project: &Project) -> Vec<(Framework, f64)> {
           let mut detections = Vec::new();
           
           for (framework, signature) in &self.signatures {
               let confidence = signature.match_score(project);
               if confidence > self.confidence_threshold {
                   detections.push((framework.clone(), confidence));
               }
           }
           
           detections.sort_by(|a, b| b.1.partial_cmp(&a.1).unwrap());
           detections
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Semantic Analysis**
   ```rust
   pub struct SemanticAnalyzer {
       name_patterns: HashMap<String, FunctionPurpose>,
       domain_terms: HashSet<String>,
       nlp_model: Option<NLPModel>,
   }
   
   impl SemanticAnalyzer {
       pub fn infer_purpose(&self, function: &Function) -> FunctionPurpose {
           // Analyze function name
           if let Some(purpose) = self.match_name_pattern(&function.name) {
               return purpose;
           }
           
           // Analyze parameter and return types
           if let Some(purpose) = self.infer_from_signature(function) {
               return purpose;
           }
           
           // Use NLP if available
           if let Some(ref model) = self.nlp_model {
               if let Some(purpose) = model.classify_function(function) {
                   return purpose;
               }
           }
           
           FunctionPurpose::Unknown
       }
   }
   ```

### Architecture Changes

1. Add `learning` module for ML components
2. Create pattern database with persistence
3. Add feedback collection system
4. Integrate with existing detection pipeline

### Data Structures

```rust
pub struct LearnedPattern {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub pattern_type: PatternType,
    pub features: FeatureVector,
    pub confidence: f64,
    pub examples: Vec<CodeExample>,
    pub last_updated: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub source: PatternSource,
}

pub enum PatternSource {
    UserFeedback,
    SuppressionComment,
    FrameworkLibrary,
    Statistical,
    Shared,
}

pub struct FeatureVector {
    pub structural: Vec<f64>,   // AST-based features
    pub semantic: Vec<f64>,     // Name and purpose features
    pub contextual: Vec<f64>,   // Surrounding code features
    pub statistical: Vec<f64>,  // Metrics and distributions
}

pub struct ProjectModel {
    pub patterns: Vec<LearnedPattern>,
    pub thresholds: HashMap<MetricType, AdaptiveThreshold>,
    pub framework_profiles: Vec<FrameworkProfile>,
    pub statistics: ProjectStatistics,
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

```rust
pub trait Learnable {
    fn learn(&mut self, example: Example, label: Label);
    fn predict(&self, features: &FeatureVector) -> Prediction;
    fn explain(&self, prediction: &Prediction) -> Explanation;
}

pub trait PatternRepository {
    fn store_pattern(&mut self, pattern: LearnedPattern) -> Result<()>;
    fn get_patterns(&self, filter: PatternFilter) -> Vec<LearnedPattern>;
    fn share_patterns(&self, anonymous: bool) -> Result<()>;
}
```

## Example Learning Scenarios

### Framework Pattern Learning
**Input**: React project with many `useEffect` hooks
**Learning**: Recognizes React hooks pattern, adjusts complexity scoring
**Result**: Stops flagging normal React patterns as complex

### Suppression Learning
**Input**: User suppresses "blocking I/O" in all test files
**Learning**: Learns that blocking I/O is acceptable in test context
**Result**: Automatically excludes similar patterns in tests

### Semantic Understanding
**Input**: Functions named `handle*` in web handlers
**Learning**: Recognizes handler pattern from naming
**Result**: Adjusts expectations for handler functions

### Threshold Adaptation
**Input**: Project with naturally high complexity
**Learning**: Calculates project-specific baselines
**Result**: Only flags outliers, not normal complexity
