# Specification 26: Fix Orchestration Misclassification

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [19 (Unified Debt Prioritization), 21 (Dead Code Detection), 23 (Call Graph Analysis)]

## Context

The current orchestration detection in debtmap incorrectly classifies certain functions as orchestration functions when they don't actually orchestrate anything. This leads to misleading debt reports showing "Orchestration function delegating to 0 functions" and incorrect recommendations to "Consider integration tests instead of unit tests", which goes against the project's functional programming philosophy.

The root issues are:
1. Functions are classified as orchestrators based on name patterns even when they have no meaningful callees
2. Simple I/O wrappers and entry points are incorrectly classified as orchestration debt
3. The orchestration name patterns are too broad, catching common non-orchestration functions

## Objective

Fix the orchestration classification logic to:
- Only classify functions as orchestrators when they actually coordinate multiple meaningful functions
- Correctly identify and classify I/O wrappers before checking for orchestration patterns
- Refine name-based detection to reduce false positives
- Align recommendations with functional programming principles (prefer unit tests and pure functions)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Meaningful Callee Validation**
   - Functions must have at least 2 meaningful callees (non-standard library) to be considered orchestrators
   - Check for meaningful callees BEFORE classifying as orchestrator
   - Empty delegate lists should never occur in orchestration debt types

2. **I/O Wrapper Priority**
   - I/O wrapper detection must take precedence over orchestration detection
   - Functions like `print_*`, `format_*`, `write_*` should be classified as IOWrapper
   - Simple I/O operations should not be flagged as orchestration debt

3. **Name Pattern Refinement**
   - Exclude common non-orchestration prefixes: `print`, `format`, `create`, `build`, `extract`, `parse`
   - Retain true orchestration patterns: `orchestrate`, `coordinate`, `manage`, `dispatch`, `route`
   - Reduce false positives from overly broad name matching

4. **Functional Programming Alignment**
   - Remove recommendations for integration tests over unit tests
   - Recommend refactoring to pure functions and composition
   - Emphasize unit testing of extracted pure functions

### Non-Functional Requirements

- No performance degradation in debt analysis
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing call graph analysis
- Preserve existing test coverage
- Clear separation of concerns between function role classification

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Functions with 0 or 1 meaningful callees are never classified as orchestrators
- [ ] Functions like `print_risk_function` are classified as IOWrapper, not Orchestrator
- [ ] No debt items show "delegating to 0 functions" in the output
- [ ] Orchestration debt recommendations suggest pure function refactoring, not integration tests
- [ ] All existing semantic classifier tests pass
- [ ] All existing unified scorer tests pass
- [ ] Name-based orchestration detection excludes common non-orchestration patterns
- [ ] I/O wrapper classification takes precedence over orchestration classification

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

#### Solution 1: Add Meaningful Callee Check (Primary Fix)
```rust
// In semantic_classifier.rs - is_orchestrator()
fn is_orchestrator(func: &FunctionMetrics, func_id: &FunctionId, call_graph: &CallGraph) -> bool {
    // First check if there are meaningful callees to orchestrate
    let callees = call_graph.get_callees(func_id);
    let meaningful_callees: Vec<_> = callees
        .iter()
        .filter(|f| !is_std_or_utility_function(&f.name))
        .collect();
    
    // Can't be an orchestrator without functions to orchestrate
    if meaningful_callees.len() < 2 {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Then check existing patterns...
    let name_suggests_orchestration = 
        is_orchestrator_by_name(&func_id.name) && func.cyclomatic <= 3;
    
    let is_simple_delegation = func.cyclomatic <= 2
        && func.cognitive <= 3
        && delegates_to_tested_functions(func_id, call_graph, 0.8);
    
    name_suggests_orchestration || is_simple_delegation
}
```

#### Solution 2: Fix Classification Order
```rust
// In semantic_classifier.rs - classify_function_role()
fn classify_function_role(
    func: &FunctionMetrics,
    func_id: &FunctionId,
    call_graph: &CallGraph,
) -> FunctionRole {
    // Entry point has highest precedence
    if is_entry_point(func_id, call_graph) {
        return FunctionRole::EntryPoint;
    }
    
    // Check I/O wrapper BEFORE orchestration
    if is_io_wrapper(func) {
        return FunctionRole::IOWrapper;
    }
    
    // Only then check orchestration patterns
    if is_orchestrator(func, func_id, call_graph) {
        return FunctionRole::Orchestrator;
    }
    
    FunctionRole::PureLogic // Default
}
```

#### Solution 3: Refine Name Patterns
```rust
// In semantic_classifier.rs - is_orchestrator_by_name()
fn is_orchestrator_by_name(name: &str) -> bool {
    let name_lower = name.to_lowercase();
    
    // Exclude common non-orchestration patterns first
    let exclude_patterns = [
        "print", "format", "create", "build", "extract", 
        "parse", "new", "from", "to", "into"
    ];
    
    for pattern in &exclude_patterns {
        if name_lower.starts_with(pattern) || name_lower.ends_with(pattern) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    // Then check for true orchestration patterns
    let orchestrator_patterns = [
        "orchestrate", "coordinate", "manage", "dispatch", "route",
        "if_requested", "if_needed", "if_enabled", "maybe",
        "try_", "attempt_", "delegate", "forward"
    ];
    
    // Check for conditional patterns
    if name_lower.contains("_if_") || name_lower.contains("_when_") {
        return true;
    }
    
    orchestrator_patterns
        .iter()
        .any(|pattern| name_lower.contains(pattern))
}
```

### Architecture Changes

- No major architectural changes required
- Modifications limited to `semantic_classifier.rs` module
- Potential minor updates to `unified_scorer.rs` for recommendation text

### Data Structures

No new data structures required. Existing structures remain unchanged:
- `FunctionRole` enum remains the same
- `DebtType::Orchestration` structure unchanged
- Call graph structures unmodified

### APIs and Interfaces

No public API changes. Internal function signatures remain compatible.

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Spec 19: Unified Debt Prioritization (provides semantic classification framework)
  - Spec 21: Dead Code Detection (shares classification logic)
  - Spec 23: Call Graph Analysis (provides callee information)
- **Affected Components**: 
  - `priority::semantic_classifier` module
  - `priority::unified_scorer` module (recommendation text only)
- **External Dependencies**: None

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test `is_orchestrator()` with 0, 1, 2, and 3+ meaningful callees
- Test classification order (I/O wrapper before orchestrator)
- Test name pattern exclusions for common non-orchestration functions
- Test that `print_risk_function` is classified as IOWrapper
- Test that `create_json_output` is not classified as Orchestrator

### Integration Tests
- Run full analysis on test codebase
- Verify no "delegating to 0 functions" in output
- Verify orchestration recommendations mention pure functions, not integration tests
- Check that simple wrapper functions have appropriate debt scores

### Regression Tests
- All existing semantic classifier tests must pass
- All existing unified scorer tests must pass
- Call graph tests remain unaffected

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- Document the meaningful callee requirement in `is_orchestrator()`
- Explain classification precedence in `classify_function_role()`
- Document excluded name patterns in `is_orchestrator_by_name()`

### User Documentation
- Update README if classification behavior changes are user-visible
- No changes to CLI documentation required

### Architecture Updates
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect refined orchestration detection logic

## Implementation Notes

### Order of Implementation
1. Implement Solution 1 first (meaningful callee check) - most critical fix
2. Then Solution 2 (classification order) - ensures correct role assignment
3. Finally Solution 3 (name pattern refinement) - reduces remaining false positives

### Testing Considerations
- Use existing test fixtures where possible
- Focus on edge cases: functions with exactly 0, 1, 2 callees
- Ensure test coverage for all excluded name patterns

### Performance Considerations
- Early return when insufficient callees improves performance
- Name pattern checks are inexpensive string operations
- No additional call graph traversals required

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
None - this is a bug fix that improves accuracy

### Compatibility
- Output format remains the same
- API contracts unchanged
- Existing configurations still valid

### Migration Path
No migration required. Users will see improved accuracy in debt reports after update.

### Rollback Strategy
If issues arise, the changes can be reverted independently:
1. Meaningful callee check can be disabled by removing the early return
2. Classification order can be reverted to original
3. Name patterns can be restored to previous list
