# Specification 15: Coverage Support for Validate Command

**Category**: testing
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [05 - Complexity-Coverage Risk Analysis, 08 - Enhanced Testing Prioritization, 09 - Fixed Complexity Calculations, 11 - Context-Aware Risk Analysis, 14 - Dependency-Aware ROI Calculation]

## Context

The debtmap project currently has two related but inconsistent coverage capabilities:

1. **`debtmap analyze`**: Accepts coverage data via `--lcov` or `--coverage-file` flags to perform complexity-coverage risk analysis, providing more accurate debt scoring and testing prioritization
2. **`debtmap validate`**: Validates technical debt against thresholds but does not accept coverage data, missing crucial information for accurate debt assessment

This inconsistency means that CI/CD pipelines using `validate` for quality gates cannot benefit from the enhanced accuracy that coverage data provides. Teams must choose between:
- Using `analyze` with coverage for accurate assessment but no threshold validation
- Using `validate` for threshold enforcement but with less accurate debt scores

The lack of coverage support in `validate` undermines the accuracy of technical debt assessments in automated quality gates, potentially allowing high-risk uncovered complex code to pass validation.

## Objective

Extend the `debtmap validate` command to accept and utilize LCOV coverage data in the same manner as the `analyze` command, ensuring consistent and accurate technical debt assessment across all debtmap commands.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Coverage File Support**: Accept LCOV coverage files via `--lcov` or `--coverage-file` flags
- **Consistent Analysis**: Use the same coverage analysis pipeline as `analyze` command
- **Threshold Integration**: Apply thresholds to coverage-adjusted risk scores
- **Risk Recalculation**: Recalculate debt scores using coverage data when available
- **Validation Accuracy**: Improve validation accuracy by considering test coverage
- **Backward Compatibility**: Continue to work without coverage data
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle missing or invalid coverage files
- **Coverage Metrics**: Include coverage metrics in validation output
- **Threshold Types**: Support coverage-specific thresholds (e.g., minimum coverage)
- **Exit Codes**: Maintain existing exit code behavior with coverage-aware validation

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Coverage parsing should not significantly impact validation speed
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stream coverage data to avoid memory issues with large files
- **Consistency**: Identical coverage handling between `analyze` and `validate`
- **Reliability**: Validation should never fail due to coverage file issues
- **Usability**: Clear messages about coverage impact on validation results

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `validate` command accepts `--lcov` and `--coverage-file` flags
- [ ] Coverage data is parsed and applied to risk calculations
- [ ] Risk scores with coverage match those from `analyze` command
- [ ] Thresholds are applied to coverage-adjusted scores
- [ ] Validation output shows coverage influence on results
- [ ] Missing coverage files produce warning but don't fail validation
- [ ] Invalid coverage data is handled gracefully with informative errors
- [ ] Coverage-specific thresholds can be configured
- [ ] Existing validation behavior unchanged when coverage not provided
- [ ] Performance impact is less than 10% for typical coverage files
- [ ] Memory usage remains constant regardless of coverage file size
- [ ] Documentation updated with coverage usage examples
- [ ] Integration tests cover all coverage scenarios
- [ ] Exit codes correctly reflect coverage-aware validation results

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

The implementation will reuse the existing coverage analysis infrastructure from the `analyze` command:

1. **Command Extension**: Add coverage flags to validate command
2. **Pipeline Integration**: Inject coverage data into validation pipeline
3. **Threshold Enhancement**: Extend threshold system for coverage metrics
4. **Output Modification**: Include coverage information in validation results

### Architecture Changes

**Modified Files**:
- `src/cli.rs` - Add coverage flags to ValidateArgs
- `src/commands/validate.rs` - Integrate coverage parsing and application
- `src/validation/mod.rs` - Extend validation logic with coverage support
- `src/config/mod.rs` - Add coverage-specific threshold configuration

**Reused Components**:
- `src/risk/lcov.rs` - Existing LCOV parser
- `src/risk/correlation.rs` - Coverage-complexity correlation
- `src/risk/strategy.rs` - Risk calculation strategies
- `src/risk/priority.rs` - Test prioritization pipeline

### Data Structures

**Extended ValidateArgs**:
```rust
#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
pub struct ValidateArgs {
    // Existing fields...
    
    /// LCOV coverage file for risk analysis
    #[arg(long, alias = "coverage-file", value_name = "FILE")]
    pub lcov: Option<PathBuf>,
    
    /// Minimum coverage percentage threshold
    #[arg(long, value_name = "PERCENTAGE")]
    pub min_coverage: Option<f64>,
    
    /// Apply coverage-aware risk calculation
    #[arg(long, default_value = "true")]
    pub use_coverage: bool,
}
```

**Coverage Validation Results**:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
pub struct CoverageValidationResult {
    pub coverage_file: Option<PathBuf>,
    pub coverage_metrics: Option<CoverageMetrics>,
    pub coverage_impact: CoverageImpact,
    pub adjusted_scores: HashMap<PathBuf, AdjustedScore>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
pub struct CoverageMetrics {
    pub line_coverage: f64,
    pub branch_coverage: Option<f64>,
    pub function_coverage: Option<f64>,
    pub uncovered_complex_functions: Vec<UncoveredFunction>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
pub struct CoverageImpact {
    pub risk_adjustment: f64,
    pub priority_changes: Vec<PriorityChange>,
    pub newly_failing: Vec<ThresholdViolation>,
    pub newly_passing: Vec<ThresholdPass>,
}
```

**Enhanced Threshold Configuration**:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct ThresholdConfig {
    // Existing thresholds...
    
    /// Coverage-specific thresholds
    pub coverage: Option<CoverageThresholds>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct CoverageThresholds {
    pub minimum_line_coverage: Option<f64>,
    pub minimum_branch_coverage: Option<f64>,
    pub maximum_uncovered_complexity: Option<u32>,
    pub critical_function_coverage: Option<f64>,
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

**Validation Pipeline Integration**:
```rust
pub fn validate_with_coverage(
    analysis_results: &AnalysisResults,
    thresholds: &ThresholdConfig,
    coverage_data: Option<&CoverageData>,
) -> ValidationResult {
    let mut results = ValidationResult::new();
    
    // Apply coverage to risk calculations if available
    let adjusted_results = if let Some(coverage) = coverage_data {
        apply_coverage_analysis(analysis_results, coverage)
    } else {
        analysis_results.clone()
    };
    
    // Validate against thresholds
    for (path, metrics) in &adjusted_results.file_metrics {
        validate_file_metrics(metrics, thresholds, &mut results);
    }
    
    // Apply coverage-specific thresholds
    if let Some(coverage) = coverage_data {
        validate_coverage_thresholds(coverage, thresholds, &mut results);
    }
    
    results
}

pub fn apply_coverage_analysis(
    results: &AnalysisResults,
    coverage: &CoverageData,
) -> AnalysisResults {
    // Reuse existing coverage analysis from analyze command
    let risk_analyzer = RiskAnalyzer::new(RiskStrategy::Enhanced);
    risk_analyzer.correlate_with_coverage(results, coverage)
}
```

**Coverage File Handling**:
```rust
pub fn load_coverage_file(path: &Path) -> Result<CoverageData> {
    // Reuse existing LCOV parser
    let parser = LcovParser::new();
    parser.parse_file(path)
        .context("Failed to parse coverage file")
}

pub fn validate_coverage_file(coverage: &CoverageData, results: &AnalysisResults) -> Result<()> {
    // Verify coverage data matches analyzed files
    let analyzed_files: HashSet<_> = results.file_metrics.keys().collect();
    let coverage_files: HashSet<_> = coverage.files.keys().collect();
    
    let intersection = analyzed_files.intersection(&coverage_files).count();
    if intersection == 0 {
        bail!("Coverage file contains no files from the analyzed codebase");
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Command-Line Interface

**Basic Usage**:
```bash
# Validate with coverage file
debtmap validate --lcov coverage/lcov.info

# Validate with coverage and custom thresholds
debtmap validate --lcov coverage/lcov.info --min-coverage 80

# Validate with coverage-specific config
debtmap validate --lcov coverage/lcov.info --config .debtmap.toml
```

**Configuration Example**:
```toml
[thresholds]
max_complexity = 10
max_debt_ratio = 0.15

[thresholds.coverage]
minimum_line_coverage = 80.0
minimum_branch_coverage = 70.0
maximum_uncovered_complexity = 5
critical_function_coverage = 95.0
```

### Validation Output Enhancement

**With Coverage**:
```
Validating with coverage from: coverage/lcov.info
Coverage: 78.5% lines, 65.2% branches

✗ Validation failed with coverage analysis:

High Risk Functions (uncovered + complex):
  src/core/analyzer.rs:process_data (complexity: 15, coverage: 0%)
  src/api/handler.rs:handle_request (complexity: 12, coverage: 10%)

Coverage Violations:
  ✗ Line coverage 78.5% below threshold 80.0%
  ✗ Branch coverage 65.2% below threshold 70.0%
  ✗ 3 functions exceed uncovered complexity threshold

Technical Debt Violations (coverage-adjusted):
  ✗ src/core/analyzer.rs: risk score 8.5 (threshold: 5.0)
    - High complexity (15) with no test coverage
    - Recommendation: Add unit tests immediately
```

### Error Handling

**Coverage File Issues**:
```rust
match load_coverage_file(&coverage_path) {
    Ok(coverage) => {
        // Validate coverage matches codebase
        if let Err(e) = validate_coverage_file(&coverage, &results) {
            eprintln!("Warning: {}", e);
            eprintln!("Proceeding with validation without coverage");
            return validate_without_coverage(results, thresholds);
        }
        validate_with_coverage(results, thresholds, Some(&coverage))
    }
    Err(e) => {
        eprintln!("Warning: Failed to load coverage file: {}", e);
        eprintln!("Proceeding with validation without coverage");
        validate_without_coverage(results, thresholds)
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

**Streaming Coverage Parser**:
```rust
pub struct StreamingLcovParser {
    buffer_size: usize,
}

impl StreamingLcovParser {
    pub fn parse_streaming<R: BufRead>(&self, reader: R) -> Result<CoverageData> {
        let mut coverage = CoverageData::new();
        let mut current_file = None;
        
        for line in reader.lines() {
            let line = line?;
            self.process_line(&line, &mut current_file, &mut coverage)?;
        }
        
        Ok(coverage)
    }
}
```

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is a purely additive feature

### Migration Path
1. **Phase 1**: Add coverage support to validate command
2. **Phase 2**: Update documentation and examples
3. **Phase 3**: Encourage adoption in CI/CD pipelines
4. **Phase 4**: Add coverage-specific thresholds
5. **Phase 5**: Deprecate coverage-unaware validation (future)

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing validate commands continue to work unchanged
- Coverage is optional and off by default if not specified
- Existing threshold configurations remain valid
- Exit codes maintain same semantics
