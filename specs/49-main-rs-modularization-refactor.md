# Specification 49: Main.rs Modularization Refactor

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

The main.rs file has grown to 4391 lines of code, violating single responsibility principle and making the codebase difficult to maintain, test, and understand. This monolithic structure contains CLI handling, configuration management, analysis orchestration, risk assessment, validation logic, and output formatting all in a single file. This violates Rust best practices and functional programming principles.

## Objective

Refactor the main.rs file into smaller, focused modules with clear separation of concerns, following idiomatic Rust patterns and functional programming principles. The refactoring should improve code organization, testability, and maintainability without requiring backwards compatibility.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Extract CLI command handlers into separate module
- Create dedicated configuration management module  
- Separate analysis orchestration logic
- Modularize risk assessment and validation functions
- Extract output formatting and reporting logic
- Create functional transformation pipelines
- Implement proper error handling with Result types
- Use pure functions wherever possible
- Minimize state and side effects

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Reduce main.rs to under 200 lines
- Each extracted module should be under 500 lines
- Maintain or improve performance characteristics
- Improve testability with isolated, pure functions
- Follow Rust idioms and conventions
- Prefer functional composition over imperative code

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Main.rs reduced to under 200 lines containing only entry point and high-level orchestration
- [ ] CLI command handling extracted to `src/commands/` module hierarchy
- [ ] Configuration structures and logic moved to dedicated `src/config/` module  
- [ ] Analysis orchestration extracted to `src/orchestration/` module
- [ ] Risk and validation logic consolidated in enhanced `src/risk/` module
- [ ] Output formatting logic moved to enhanced `src/io/` module
- [ ] All tests pass without modification
- [ ] No performance regression (benchmark analysis time)
- [ ] Each module has clear, single responsibility
- [ ] Functions are pure where possible, with IO at boundaries
- [ ] Proper error propagation using Result types throughout

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Module Structure**:
   ```
   src/
   ├── main.rs                 # Entry point only (~100 lines)
   ├── commands/               # CLI command handlers
   │   ├── mod.rs             # Command dispatch
   │   ├── analyze.rs         # Analyze command logic
   │   ├── validate.rs        # Validate command logic
   │   └── init.rs            # Init command logic
   ├── config/                # Configuration management
   │   ├── mod.rs             # Config types
   │   ├── analyze.rs         # AnalyzeConfig
   │   └── validate.rs        # ValidateConfig
   ├── orchestration/         # Analysis orchestration
   │   ├── mod.rs             # Orchestration traits
   │   ├── analyzer.rs        # Analysis pipeline
   │   ├── duplication.rs     # Duplication detection
   │   └── call_graph.rs      # Call graph building
   ├── validation/            # Validation logic
   │   ├── mod.rs             # Validation types
   │   ├── rules.rs           # Validation rules
   │   └── reporter.rs        # Validation reporting
   └── reporting/             # Enhanced output formatting
       ├── mod.rs             # Reporting traits
       ├── json.rs            # JSON output
       ├── markdown.rs        # Markdown output
       └── terminal.rs        # Terminal output
   ```

2. **Functional Patterns**:
   - Use function composition for building analysis pipelines
   - Implement transformations as pure functions
   - Use Result<T, E> for all fallible operations
   - Leverage Iterator combinators for data processing
   - Apply dependency injection for testability

3. **Key Refactorings**:
   - Extract `handle_analyze` → `commands::analyze::execute`
   - Extract `analyze_project` → `orchestration::analyzer::analyze`
   - Extract validation functions → `validation` module
   - Extract risk analysis → enhanced `risk` module functions
   - Extract output functions → `reporting` module
   - Convert imperative loops to functional pipelines using map/filter/fold

### Architecture Changes

- Main.rs becomes thin orchestration layer
- Commands module handles CLI dispatch
- Configuration becomes first-class module
- Analysis orchestration separated from command handling
- Validation logic consolidated and made testable
- Output formatting becomes pluggable and extensible

### Data Structures

No new data structures required; existing types will be reorganized into appropriate modules.

### APIs and Interfaces

```rust
// commands/mod.rs
pub trait CommandHandler {
    fn execute(&self) -> Result<()>;
}

// orchestration/mod.rs  
pub trait AnalysisPipeline {
    fn analyze(&self, config: &Config) -> Result<AnalysisResults>;
}

// reporting/mod.rs
pub trait Reporter {
    fn report(&self, results: &AnalysisResults) -> Result<()>;
}
```

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**: All components that import from main.rs (minimal, mostly tests)
- **External Dependencies**: No new dependencies

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test each extracted module in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure existing integration tests pass unchanged
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark analysis time before/after refactoring
- **User Acceptance**: CLI behavior remains identical

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Document module purposes and public APIs
- **User Documentation**: No changes needed (interface unchanged)
- **Architecture Updates**: Update ARCHITECTURE.md with new module structure

## Implementation Notes

1. Start with extracting configuration structures as they have fewest dependencies
2. Extract command handlers next to establish command pattern
3. Move analysis orchestration functions maintaining pure functional style
4. Extract validation and risk logic preserving existing algorithms
5. Finally extract output formatting maintaining format compatibility
6. Use git mv to preserve history where possible
7. Run tests after each extraction to ensure correctness

## Migration and Compatibility

- No backwards compatibility required per specification
- Internal APIs can change freely
- Focus on clean, idiomatic design over compatibility
- CLI interface remains unchanged for users
