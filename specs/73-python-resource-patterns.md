# Specification 73: Python Resource Management Pattern Detection

**Category**: foundation
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

The Rust analyzer includes resource management pattern detection for Drop implementations, async resources, and unbounded collections. While Rust's ownership system makes resource management explicit, Python relies on garbage collection and context managers. The Python analyzer lacks detection for resource management issues, which can lead to memory leaks, file descriptor exhaustion, and other resource-related problems.

Common Python resource issues include:
- Unclosed file handles and network connections
- Missing context managers for resources
- Circular references preventing garbage collection
- Unbounded cache growth
- Thread and process leaks

## Objective

Implement comprehensive resource management pattern detection for Python, adapted to Python's garbage collection model and context manager protocols, identifying potential resource leaks and management issues.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Detect missing context managers for resource objects
- Identify potential circular references
- Find unbounded collection growth patterns
- Detect unclosed resources (files, sockets, connections)
- Identify missing `__del__` or cleanup methods
- Track async resource management issues
- Detect thread/process management problems

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Python-idiomatic detection patterns
- Low false positive rate for common patterns
- Efficient static analysis without runtime
- Configurable resource type definitions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PythonResourceDetector trait implementation
- [ ] Context manager usage validation
- [ ] Circular reference pattern detection
- [ ] Unbounded collection detection
- [ ] File/socket resource tracking
- [ ] Async resource management checks
- [ ] Thread/process lifecycle validation
- [ ] Integration with debt item generation
- [ ] Configuration for custom resource types
- [ ] Unit tests for each pattern
- [ ] Documentation of detected patterns

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. Create `resource::python` module
2. Implement detectors for Python-specific patterns
3. Track resource allocation and cleanup patterns
4. Analyze context manager usage
5. Integrate with Python analyzer

### Architecture Changes
- New module: `src/resource/python/`
- Python-specific resource detectors
- Integration with existing resource detection framework

### Data Structures
```rust
pub trait PythonResourceDetector {
    fn detect_issues(&self, module: &ast::Mod, path: &Path) -> Vec<ResourceIssue>;
    fn assess_resource_impact(&self, issue: &ResourceIssue) -> ResourceImpact;
}

pub struct PythonContextManagerDetector {
    resource_types: HashSet<String>,
    safe_patterns: Vec<String>,
}

pub struct PythonCircularRefDetector {
    max_depth: usize,
    known_patterns: Vec<CircularPattern>,
}

pub struct PythonUnboundedCollectionDetector {
    growth_patterns: Vec<GrowthPattern>,
    size_thresholds: HashMap<String, usize>,
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces
- `PythonResourceDetector` implementations
- Integration with `analyze_python_file`
- Resource impact assessment

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**: 
  - `src/analyzers/python.rs`
  - `src/resource/mod.rs`
  - `src/core/debt.rs`
- **External Dependencies**: rustpython_parser (existing)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual resource patterns
- **Integration Tests**: Full module analysis
- **Pattern Tests**: Known problematic patterns
- **Framework Tests**: Django/Flask/FastAPI patterns

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Detection algorithms
- **User Documentation**: Resource management best practices
- **Examples**: Common issues and fixes

## Implementation Notes

- Handle `with` statement analysis
- Track `open()`, `socket()`, `connect()` calls
- Consider `__enter__`/`__exit__` protocol
- Account for `try/finally` cleanup patterns
- Handle async context managers (`async with`)
- Consider popular libraries (requests, urllib, etc.)

## Migration and Compatibility

During prototype phase: New feature with no breaking changes. Resource patterns will be added as new debt items without affecting existing analysis.
