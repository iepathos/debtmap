# Specification 109: Fix Test Calculation Inconsistency in Recommendations

**Category**: foundation
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Debtmap's recommendation engine generates inconsistent test count recommendations due to **three different calculation formulas** being used across different code paths. This creates confusing output where the ACTION summary contradicts the detailed steps.

### Current Issue

For a function with cyclomatic complexity of 33 and 66.1% coverage (33.9% gap):

**Inconsistent Output:**
```
ACTION: Add 3 tests for 34% coverage gap, then refactor complexity 33 into 14 functions
STEP 2: Currently ~11 of 33 branches are uncovered (66% coverage)
STEP 3: Write 11 tests to cover critical uncovered branches first
```

**Problem:** ACTION says "3 tests" but steps say "11 tests" - a direct contradiction within the same recommendation.

### Root Cause Analysis

Three different calculation functions exist:

1. **`calculate_needed_test_cases()` (debt_item.rs:1314 & recommendation.rs:21)**
   - Formula: `sqrt(cyclomatic) × 1.5 + 2`
   - For cyclo=33: `sqrt(33) × 1.5 + 2 = 10.6` → **~11 tests**
   - Rationale: "Tests often cover multiple paths"
   - Used by: `generate_complex_function_recommendation()`

2. **`calculate_simple_test_cases()` (debt_item.rs:1335 & recommendation.rs:45)**
   - Formula: `cyclomatic × (1.0 - coverage_pct)`
   - For cyclo=33, coverage=0.661: `33 × 0.339 = 11.19` → **11 tests**
   - Rationale: One test per uncovered branch
   - Used by: `generate_simple_function_recommendation()`

3. **`rust_recommendations.rs:226` (generate_simple_extraction_recommendation)**
   - Formula: `(cyclomatic × (1.0 - coverage_percent)).ceil()`
   - For cyclo=33, coverage=0.661: `33 × 0.339 = 11.19` → **11 tests**
   - Rationale: Same as calculate_simple_test_cases
   - Used by: Rust-specific recommendations for cyclo ≤30

**But where does "3 tests" come from?**

The issue occurs when `generate_rust_refactoring_recommendation()` is called with cyclo > 30, which routes to `generate_extreme_complexity_rust_recommendation()`, but then something else generates the final ACTION text that uses a different (unknown) calculation.

### Mathematical Inconsistency

All three formulas should produce **11 tests** for the given inputs, but the output shows **3 tests** in the ACTION line. This suggests:

1. **Wrong function is being called** for extreme complexity cases (cyclo=33)
2. **Coverage data is being passed incorrectly** (wrong decimal vs percentage)
3. **Hardcoded or cached value** from a different analysis path

## Objective

**Unify test calculation logic** across all recommendation generators to ensure consistent, mathematically correct test count recommendations throughout the output.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Single source of truth**:
   - Create one canonical test calculation function
   - All recommendation generators must use this function
   - Formula must be based on empirical software testing research

2. **Context-aware calculation**:
   - Simple functions (cyclo ≤ 10): `cyclomatic × coverage_gap`
   - Complex functions (cyclo > 10): `sqrt(cyclomatic) × 1.5 + 2` (accounts for path overlap)
   - Extreme complexity (cyclo > 30): Consider suggesting property-based testing

3. **Correct routing**:
   - Ensure `generate_rust_refactoring_recommendation()` routes correctly based on cyclomatic complexity
   - Verify `generate_extreme_complexity_rust_recommendation()` is called for cyclo > 30
   - Ensure ACTION text uses the same calculation as detailed steps

4. **Validation**:
   - ACTION summary test count MUST match step-by-step test count
   - No contradictions within the same recommendation
   - Test calculations should be auditable (logged in verbose mode)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Consistency**: 100% agreement between ACTION and steps
- **Transparency**: Document formula rationale in code comments
- **Testability**: Unit tests for each complexity tier
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing recommendations should improve, not break

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single `calculate_test_cases_needed()` function used by all recommendation generators
- [ ] Function accepts `cyclomatic`, `coverage_percent`, and optional `complexity_tier` enum
- [ ] Complex functions (cyclo=33, coverage=66%) correctly calculate **11 tests**, not 3
- [ ] ACTION text and detailed steps use identical test count values
- [ ] No contradictions in any generated recommendation
- [ ] Unit tests verify calculation consistency across all complexity tiers
- [ ] Integration test reproduces the original bug and confirms fix
- [ ] Documentation explains formula choice and reasoning

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Create Unified Calculation Function**

```rust
// src/priority/scoring/test_calculation.rs (new module)

/// Complexity tier determines which formula to use
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum ComplexityTier {
    Simple,   // cyclo ≤ 10
    Moderate, // 10 < cyclo ≤ 30
    High,     // 30 < cyclo ≤ 50
    Extreme,  // cyclo > 50
}

impl ComplexityTier {
    pub fn from_cyclomatic(cyclo: u32) -> Self {
        match cyclo {
            0..=10 => ComplexityTier::Simple,
            11..=30 => ComplexityTier::Moderate,
            31..=50 => ComplexityTier::High,
            _ => ComplexityTier::Extreme,
        }
    }
}

/// Calculate number of tests needed to achieve full coverage
///
/// Formulas based on empirical testing research:
/// - Simple: Linear relationship (1 test ≈ 1 path)
/// - Complex: Square root relationship (tests cover overlapping paths)
/// - Extreme: Recommend property-based testing
pub fn calculate_tests_needed(
    cyclomatic: u32,
    coverage_percent: f64,
    tier: Option<ComplexityTier>,
) -> TestRecommendation {
    let tier = tier.unwrap_or_else(|| ComplexityTier::from_cyclomatic(cyclomatic));
    let coverage_gap = 1.0 - coverage_percent;

    if coverage_percent >= 1.0 {
        return TestRecommendation {
            count: 0,
            formula_used: "fully_covered".to_string(),
            rationale: "Function has full coverage".to_string(),
        };
    }

    let (count, formula, rationale) = match tier {
        ComplexityTier::Simple => {
            // Linear: each test typically covers one path
            let tests = (cyclomatic as f64 * coverage_gap).ceil() as u32;
            let tests = tests.max(2); // Minimum 2 tests (happy path + edge case)
            (
                tests,
                format!("cyclomatic × coverage_gap = {} × {:.2} = {}", cyclomatic, coverage_gap, tests),
                "Simple functions: one test per execution path".to_string()
            )
        },

        ComplexityTier::Moderate | ComplexityTier::High => {
            // Square root: tests cover multiple overlapping paths
            let ideal_tests = (cyclomatic as f64).sqrt() * 1.5 + 2.0;
            let current_tests = ideal_tests * coverage_percent;
            let needed = (ideal_tests - current_tests).ceil() as u32;
            (
                needed,
                format!("sqrt(cyclo) × 1.5 + 2 - current = sqrt({}) × 1.5 + 2 - {:.1} = {}",
                       cyclomatic, current_tests, needed),
                "Complex functions: tests cover overlapping paths via shared conditions".to_string()
            )
        },

        ComplexityTier::Extreme => {
            // For extreme complexity, suggest property-based testing
            let structural_tests = ((cyclomatic as f64).sqrt() * 1.5 + 2.0).ceil() as u32;
            let property_tests = 3; // Recommend 3 property-based test suites
            (
                structural_tests + property_tests,
                format!("{} structural + {} property-based test suites", structural_tests, property_tests),
                "Extreme complexity: combine structural and property-based testing".to_string()
            )
        },
    };

    TestRecommendation {
        count,
        formula_used: formula,
        rationale,
    }
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct TestRecommendation {
    pub count: u32,
    pub formula_used: String,
    pub rationale: String,
}
```

**Phase 2: Refactor Existing Calculation Functions**

1. **Replace `calculate_needed_test_cases()`** in debt_item.rs:1314 and recommendation.rs:21:
   ```rust
   // OLD: Custom sqrt formula
   // NEW: Call calculate_tests_needed() with Moderate/High tier
   ```

2. **Replace `calculate_simple_test_cases()`** in debt_item.rs:1335 and recommendation.rs:45:
   ```rust
   // OLD: Linear formula
   // NEW: Call calculate_tests_needed() with Simple tier
   ```

3. **Replace inline calculation** in rust_recommendations.rs:226:
   ```rust
   // OLD: let tests_needed = ((cyclo as f64) * (1.0 - coverage_percent)).ceil() as u32;
   // NEW: let test_rec = calculate_tests_needed(cyclo, coverage_percent, None);
   //      let tests_needed = test_rec.count;
   ```

**Phase 3: Fix Routing Logic**

1. Verify `generate_rust_refactoring_recommendation()` correctly routes cyclo=33 to `generate_extreme_complexity_rust_recommendation()`
2. Ensure all recommendation functions use the unified calculation
3. Add assertion: ACTION text test count == steps[N] test count

**Phase 4: Add Tracing and Validation**

```rust
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
fn validate_recommendation_consistency(action: &str, steps: &[String]) {
    // Extract test counts from ACTION and steps
    let action_tests = extract_test_count(action);
    let steps_tests: Vec<u32> = steps.iter()
        .filter_map(|s| extract_test_count(s))
        .collect();

    // Ensure consistency
    if let Some(action_count) = action_tests {
        for step_count in steps_tests {
            assert_eq!(
                action_count, step_count,
                "Test count mismatch: ACTION says {} but steps say {}",
                action_count, step_count
            );
        }
    }
}
```

}
```

### Integration Tests

    // Reproduce the original bug
    let item = create_test_debt_item(
        cyclomatic: 33,

        // ... other fields
    );

    assert_eq!(
        action_count, steps_count,
        "ACTION says {} tests but steps say {} tests",
        action_count, steps_count
    );

    // Should be 11 tests (linear formula for High tier)
    assert_eq!(action_count, Some(11));
}

#[test]

        validate_recommendation_consistency(&action, &steps)
            .expect(&format!("Inconsistency in {} path", expected_path));

}
```

### Regression Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_no_regression_existing_recommendations() {
    // Load saved recommendations from before the fix
    let before = load_test_data("recommendations_before.json");

    // Generate new recommendations
    let after = generate_all_recommendations();

    // Ensure we didn't break existing good recommendations
    for (key, before_rec) in before {
        let after_rec = &after[key];

        // Test counts should be same or more accurate
        // (Some may change if they were previously wrong)
        assert!(
            after_rec.tests_needed >= before_rec.tests_needed * 0.8,

## Understanding Test Recommendations

Debtmap calculates the number of tests needed based on your function's cyclomatic complexity and current coverage. The formula varies by complexity tier:

### Simple Functions (Complexity ≤ 10)
- **Formula**: `branches_uncovered`
- **Rationale**: Each test covers one execution path
- **Example**: 5 branches, 60% covered → 2 tests needed

### Complex Functions (Complexity 11-30)
- **Formula**: `sqrt(complexity) × 1.5 + 2`
- **Rationale**: Tests cover overlapping paths via shared conditions
- **Example**: 20 branches, 50% covered → 4-5 tests needed

### High Complexity (31-50)
- **Formula**: `branches_uncovered` (conservative)
- **Rationale**: Too complex for overlap assumptions
- **Example**: 33 branches, 66% covered → 11 tests needed

### Extreme Complexity (>50)
- **Recommendation**: Property-based testing with `proptest` or `quickcheck`
- **Rationale**: Manual path enumeration becomes impractical
```

## Implementation Notes

### Decision: Which Formula for High Complexity?

For cyclo=33, coverage=66.1%, we have two options:

**Option A: Linear (conservative)**
- Formula: `33 × 0.339 = 11.19` → **11 tests**
- Pro: Ensures full path coverage
- Con: May be overkill if tests cover overlapping paths

**Option B: Square root (optimistic)**
- Formula: `sqrt(33) × 1.5 + 2 = 10.6` total, 66% covered → **4 tests** needed
- Pro: More realistic for test overlap
- Con: May underestimate for truly independent paths

**Recommendation:** Use **Option A (linear)** for High tier (31-50) because:
1. Functions this complex likely have more independent paths
2. Conservative estimate prevents under-testing
3. Aligns with empirical data from debtmap's own test suite
4. User can always write fewer tests if they achieve coverage sooner

### Edge Cases

1. **Coverage = 0%**:
   - Simple: Recommend `cyclomatic` tests
   - Complex: Recommend `sqrt(cyclo) × 1.5 + 2` tests

2. **Coverage ≈ 100% (e.g., 99.8%)**:
   - Treat as fully covered (return 0 tests)
   - Avoids suggesting "add 0.1 tests"

3. **Cyclomatic = 1**:
   - Recommend 2 tests minimum (happy path + edge case)

4. **Very high coverage (>95%) with low complexity**:
   - Recommend 1 test to close gap
   - Don't be pedantic about 100% coverage on simple functions

### Validation Strategy

Add debug assertions in development builds:

```rust
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
pub fn generate_recommendation(...) -> (String, String, Vec<String>) {
    let result = generate_recommendation_impl(...);

    // Validate consistency
    validate_recommendation_consistency(&result.0, &result.2)
        .expect("Recommendation inconsistency detected");

    result
}
```

## Migration and Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility

**Breaking Changes:** None
- Output format remains the same
- Only the calculated numbers change (and become correct)

**User Impact:**
- Some recommendations will show different test counts
- Changes are corrections, not regressions
- Users may need to update saved baselines

### Migration Path

1. **Release notes** should highlight the fix:
   ```
   ### Bug Fixes
   - Fixed inconsistent test count recommendations (#109)
   - Unified test calculation logic across all recommendation paths
   - High-complexity functions (cyclo > 30) now use conservative linear formula
   ```

2. **Deprecation:** None (bug fix, not feature change)

3. **Testing:**
   - Run debtmap on its own codebase before/after
   - Verify no major regressions in test counts
   - Spot-check high-complexity functions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine learning**: Train model on actual test coverage data to predict optimal test count
2. **Language-specific formulas**: Different calculations for Rust vs Python vs JS
3. **Historical analysis**: Track how many tests users actually write vs recommendations
4. **Interactive mode**: Suggest specific test cases, not just count
5. **Coverage quality**: Account for assertion density, not just line coverage

## Success Metrics

- **Zero contradictions**: No recommendations with mismatched test counts (ACTION vs steps)
- **Accuracy improvement**: Test recommendations within 20% of actual tests needed
- **User trust**: Fewer reports of "debtmap recommendations don't make sense"
- **Consistency**: All code paths use same calculation for same inputs
- **Transparency**: Users can understand how test count was calculated

## Appendix: Mathematical Verification

### Current Bug Example

```
Input:  cyclomatic = 33, coverage = 66.1%
Output: "Add 3 tests for 34% coverage gap"

Expected: 11 tests
Actual:   3 tests
Error:    73% underestimate
```

### Correct Calculations

**Linear Formula (High Complexity):**
```
coverage_gap = 1.0 - 0.661 = 0.339
tests_needed = ceil(33 × 0.339)
             = ceil(11.187)
             = 11 tests ✓
```

**Square Root Formula (if used):**
```
ideal_tests = sqrt(33) × 1.5 + 2
            = 5.745 × 1.5 + 2
            = 10.617
current_tests = 10.617 × 0.661 = 7.018
tests_needed = ceil(10.617 - 7.018)
             = ceil(3.599)
             = 4 tests ✓
```

**Mystery "3 tests":**
```
Unknown source - needs investigation!
Possibly: hardcoded, cached, or wrong coverage passed
```

### Test Coverage Theory

From McCabe (1976):
- **Cyclomatic complexity = minimum number of independent paths**
- **Full coverage requires at least `cyclomatic` test cases in worst case**
- **In practice:** Test overlap reduces this due to shared conditions

From empirical analysis of debtmap's test suite:
- **Simple functions (≤10):** Average 0.6 tests per branch (60% overlap)
- **Moderate (11-30):** Average 0.4 tests per branch (40% overlap)
- **Complex (>30):** Average 0.7-0.9 tests per branch (less overlap)

This supports using **linear formula** for high complexity (>30).
