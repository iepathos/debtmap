# Specification 70: Python Entropy Analysis Support

**Category**: foundation
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

The Rust analyzer includes sophisticated entropy analysis to measure code randomness and repetition patterns, providing valuable metrics for code quality assessment. The Python analyzer currently lacks this capability entirely, with entropy scoring marked as TODO in the codebase. This creates a significant gap in Python code analysis capabilities.

Entropy analysis helps identify:
- Code with high randomness (potentially generated or cryptographic)
- Repetitive patterns indicating potential refactoring opportunities
- Token diversity and distribution patterns
- Areas of code that may benefit from abstraction

## Objective

Implement comprehensive entropy analysis for Python code that matches or exceeds the capabilities of the Rust analyzer, providing entropy scores for Python functions and modules to enhance code quality assessment.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Calculate token entropy for Python AST nodes
- Measure pattern repetition in Python code structures
- Provide entropy scores at function and module levels
- Support configurable entropy thresholds
- Integrate with existing Python complexity metrics

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance overhead < 5% for typical Python files
- Thread-safe entropy calculation
- Deterministic results for identical code
- Memory-efficient token analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EntropyAnalyzer implemented for Python AST
- [ ] Token entropy calculation (0.0 to 1.0 scale)
- [ ] Pattern repetition detection for Python constructs
- [ ] Entropy scores included in FunctionMetrics
- [ ] Configuration support via EntropyConfig
- [ ] Unit tests with > 90% coverage
- [ ] Integration with Python analyzer pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarks showing < 5% overhead

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. Create `complexity::python_entropy` module
2. Port EntropyAnalyzer to work with rustpython_parser AST
3. Implement Python-specific token classification
4. Add entropy field to Python FunctionMetrics
5. Integrate with analyze_python_file workflow

### Architecture Changes
- New module: `src/complexity/python_entropy.rs`
- Extend PythonAnalyzer to calculate entropy
- Add entropy configuration to Python analysis

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct PythonEntropyAnalyzer {
    token_counts: HashMap<String, usize>,
    total_tokens: usize,
    pattern_cache: HashMap<u64, usize>,
}

pub struct PythonEntropyScore {
    pub token_entropy: f32,
    pub pattern_repetition: f32,
    pub overall_score: f32,
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces
- `PythonEntropyAnalyzer::calculate_entropy(&mut self, stmts: &[ast::Stmt]) -> PythonEntropyScore`
- Integration with existing Python metrics extraction

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**: 
  - `src/analyzers/python.rs`
  - `src/core/metrics.rs`
- **External Dependencies**: rustpython_parser (existing)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Token counting, entropy calculation, pattern detection
- **Integration Tests**: Full Python file analysis with entropy
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark against large Python files
- **Validation**: Compare results with known entropy patterns

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Inline documentation for entropy algorithms
- **User Documentation**: Explain entropy metrics in output
- **Architecture Updates**: Document Python entropy integration

## Implementation Notes

- Reuse token classification logic where possible
- Consider Python-specific patterns (list comprehensions, decorators)
- Handle Python 3.x syntax variations
- Account for docstrings and comments appropriately

## Migration and Compatibility

During prototype phase: This is a new feature addition with no breaking changes to existing functionality. Entropy scores will be optional and backward compatible.
