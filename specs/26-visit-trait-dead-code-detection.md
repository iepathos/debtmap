# Specification 26: Enhanced Dead Code Detection for Visit Trait and Advanced Rust Patterns

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

The recent integration of EnhancedCallGraphBuilder provides the foundation for more accurate dead code detection through trait dispatch resolution, function pointer tracking, and framework pattern detection. However, the current implementation still incorrectly marks certain valid code patterns as dead, particularly:

1. **Visit Trait Implementations**: Methods in `impl Visit for Type` blocks are called by the visitor pattern infrastructure but appear as dead code because the trait dispatch isn't fully tracked.

2. **Framework-Managed Code**: Functions that are entry points for frameworks (like syn's visitor pattern) are not recognized as having external callers.

3. **Trait Method Calls**: When a method is called through a trait object or generic trait bound, the connection between caller and implementation isn't established.

The foundation is now in place with the EnhancedCallGraphBuilder integration, but additional work is needed to fully leverage these capabilities for accurate dead code detection.

## Objective

Enhance dead code detection to correctly identify and exclude valid code patterns that are called through trait dispatch, visitor patterns, and framework infrastructure, reducing false positives and providing more accurate technical debt analysis.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Visit Trait Pattern Recognition**
   - Detect `impl Visit for Type` and `impl<'ast> Visit<'ast> for Type` implementations
   - Track method calls from visitor infrastructure (e.g., `syn::visit::visit_*` functions)
   - Link visitor methods to their trait dispatch calls
   - Recognize self-recursive visitor patterns

2. **Trait Dispatch Resolution**
   - Resolve method calls through trait objects (`&dyn Trait`, `Box<dyn Trait>`)
   - Track generic trait bounds and their implementations
   - Connect trait method calls to concrete implementations
   - Handle multiple implementations of the same trait

3. **Framework Entry Point Detection**
   - Identify framework-specific entry points beyond current patterns
   - Support visitor pattern frameworks (syn, quote, proc-macro2)
   - Detect builder pattern implementations
   - Recognize iterator trait implementations

4. **Call Graph Enhancement**
   - Add "trait dispatch" edges to the call graph
   - Track "framework managed" function attributes
   - Implement "reachable from trait" analysis
   - Support transitive trait call resolution

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Analysis overhead should not exceed 10% of current execution time
   - Cache trait resolution results for repeated analyses
   - Minimize AST traversal passes

2. **Accuracy**
   - Reduce false positive dead code detection by at least 50%
   - Maintain 100% accuracy for true dead code detection
   - Provide confidence levels for dead code classifications

3. **Maintainability**
   - Modular design for adding new framework patterns
   - Clear separation between different pattern detection strategies
   - Comprehensive unit tests for each pattern type

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Visit trait implementations are correctly identified as reachable code
- [ ] Methods called through trait dispatch are not marked as dead
- [ ] Framework entry points are recognized and excluded from dead code
- [ ] PatternVisitor::analyze_attribute is no longer marked as dead code
- [ ] Call graph includes trait dispatch edges with appropriate metadata
- [ ] Performance impact is within 10% of baseline
- [ ] Unit tests cover all new pattern detection logic
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end dead code detection
- [ ] Documentation updated with supported patterns and limitations

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Phase 1: Visit Trait Pattern Detection**
   ```rust
   // Detect Visit trait implementations
   fn detect_visit_impl(item_impl: &ItemImpl) -> bool {
       // Check if implementing Visit or Visit<'_> trait
       // Track all methods in the impl block
       // Mark as framework-managed
   }
   ```

2. **Phase 2: Trait Method Resolution**
   ```rust
   // Enhanced trait registry
   struct TraitMethodResolver {
       trait_impls: HashMap<TraitName, Vec<ImplInfo>>,
       method_to_trait: HashMap<MethodName, TraitName>,
       trait_calls: Vec<TraitCall>,
   }
   ```

3. **Phase 3: Framework Pattern Registry**
   ```rust
   // Extensible framework pattern system
   trait FrameworkPattern {
       fn matches(&self, item: &Item) -> bool;
       fn extract_managed_functions(&self, item: &Item) -> Vec<FunctionId>;
   }
   ```

### Architecture Changes

1. **TraitRegistry Enhancement**
   - Add Visit trait special handling
   - Implement trait method resolution cache
   - Support generic trait bound tracking

2. **CallGraph Extensions**
   - Add `CallType::TraitDispatch` variant
   - Include `is_framework_managed` flag on functions
   - Implement `get_trait_reachable_functions()` method

3. **Dead Code Analyzer Updates**
   - Check trait reachability before marking as dead
   - Consult framework pattern registry
   - Provide dead code confidence scores

### Data Structures

```rust
// Enhanced function metadata
struct FunctionMetadata {
    // Existing fields...
    is_trait_impl: bool,
    trait_name: Option<String>,
    is_framework_managed: bool,
    framework_type: Option<FrameworkType>,
}

// Trait call information
struct TraitCall {
    caller: FunctionId,
    trait_name: String,
    method_name: String,
    resolved_implementations: Vec<FunctionId>,
}

// Framework pattern types
enum FrameworkType {
    Visitor,
    Builder,
    Iterator,
    Handler,
    Callback,
    Custom(String),
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

```rust
// Enhanced dead code detection API
impl DeadCodeAnalyzer {
    pub fn analyze_with_traits(&self, func: &FunctionMetrics) -> DeadCodeResult {
        // Check basic reachability
        // Check trait reachability
        // Check framework management
        // Return result with confidence
    }
    
    pub fn get_trait_reachable_functions(&self) -> HashSet<FunctionId> {
        // Return all functions reachable through traits
    }
}
```

## Dependencies

## Implementation Notes

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Start with Visit trait pattern as it's the most common and well-defined case.

2. **Caching Strategy**: Cache trait resolution results at the module level to avoid repeated analysis.

3. **Confidence Scoring**: Implement a confidence scoring system where:
   - Direct calls = 100% confidence dead if no callers
   - Trait implementations = 50% confidence dead if trait not used
   - Framework managed = 10% confidence dead (likely false positive)

4. **Extensibility**: Design the framework pattern system to be easily extended with new patterns without modifying core logic.

5. **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure existing dead code detection continues to work for projects not using these patterns.

## Migration and Compatibility

- **Breaking Changes**: None - this is an enhancement to existing functionality
- **Configuration**: Add option to disable trait-based dead code detection if needed
- **Performance**: Projects not using these patterns should see minimal performance impact
- **Rollback**: Easy rollback by disabling enhanced detection in configuration
