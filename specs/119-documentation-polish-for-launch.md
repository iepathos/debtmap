# Specification 119: Documentation Polish for Phase 1 Launch

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Debtmap is preparing for its Phase 1 awareness campaign (targeting 1,000 GitHub stars and 500 weekly downloads). The project has an mdbook-based documentation site at `book/` that is automatically kept in sync with codebase changes via the `workflows/book-docs-drift.yml` workflow.

**Current State**:
- ✅ mdbook infrastructure exists (`book/` directory)
- ✅ Automated drift detection configured (`.prodigy/book-config.json`, `workflows/data/debtmap-chapters.json`)
- ✅ Basic chapters: introduction, getting-started, cli-reference, configuration, etc.
- ⚠️ Code examples may not all run successfully
- ⚠️ Missing "Why Debtmap?" section explaining entropy analysis uniqueness
- ⚠️ Missing architecture diagram showing analysis pipeline
- ⚠️ Missing screenshot/ASCII examples of terminal output
- ⚠️ Missing FAQ section answering common objections
- ⚠️ Documentation may not reflect latest features (needs drift detection run)

**Goal**: Polish documentation to be launch-ready by enhancing the mdbook content with comprehensive explanations, visual aids, and validation that all examples work. Updates will be picked up by the automated drift detection workflow.

## Objective

Enhance the debtmap mdbook documentation for Phase 1 launch by:
1. Validating and fixing all code examples to ensure they run successfully
2. Adding a comprehensive "Why Debtmap?" chapter explaining entropy analysis and unique features
3. Creating architecture diagrams showing the analysis pipeline
4. Adding terminal output examples (screenshots or ASCII art)
5. Creating an FAQ chapter answering common objections and questions
6. Updating `.prodigy/book-config.json` and `workflows/data/debtmap-chapters.json` to include new chapters
7. Running automated drift detection to ensure documentation reflects latest codebase features

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Code Example Validation (2 hours)**

1. **Audit Existing Examples**:
   - Review all chapters: getting-started.md, cli-reference.md, analysis-guide.md, configuration.md, output-formats.md, examples.md
   - Extract code blocks marked with `bash` or `sh`
   - Create validation script to test each example

2. **Test and Fix Examples**:
   ```bash
   # Example validation script
   #!/bin/bash
   # Extract and test code examples from markdown
   for chapter in book/src/*.md; do
       echo "Testing examples in $chapter"
       # Extract bash code blocks
       # Run against current debtmap
       # Report failures
   done
   ```

3. **Add Output Examples**:
   - After each command example, show expected output
   - Use collapsed sections for long output
   - Example:
   ```markdown
   ```bash
   debtmap analyze . --top 5
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>Example output:</summary>

   ```
   #1 SCORE: 8.9 [CRITICAL]
   ├─ TEST GAP: ./src/parser.rs:38 parse_input()
   ...
   ```
   </details>
   ```

**Phase 2: "Why Debtmap?" Chapter (1.5 hours)**

1. **Create Chapter File**: `book/src/why-debtmap.md`

2. **Structure**:
   ```markdown
   # Why Debtmap?

   ## The Problem with Traditional Static Analysis

   Traditional tools flag everything as "complex" without telling you what actually needs attention...

   ## Debtmap's Unique Approach

   ### 1. Entropy-Based Complexity Analysis

   (Explain with visual example)

   **Traditional Analysis**:
   ```rust
   fn validate_input(data: &Data) -> Result<()> {
       if data.field1.is_none() { return Err(...) }
       if data.field2.is_none() { return Err(...) }
       // ... 20 similar checks
       Ok(())
   }
   // Cyclomatic Complexity: 20 (flagged as critical!)
   ```

   **Debtmap's Entropy Analysis**:
   ```
   Pattern detected: repetitive null checks
   Entropy score: 0.3 (low variety)
   Effective complexity: 5 (reduced by 75%)
   ```

   ### 2. Coverage-Risk Correlation

   Debtmap uniquely combines complexity with test coverage...

   ### 3. Actionable Recommendations

   Compare:
   - SonarQube: "Function too complex"
   - Debtmap: "Extract 6 functions from 16 branches, add 8 tests for 100% coverage, impact: -7.0 risk"

   ## When to Use Debtmap vs Alternatives

   | Use Case | Recommended Tool |
   |----------|------------------|

   ```
   ```

**Phase 5: FAQ Chapter (1.5 hours)**

1. **Create Chapter**: `book/src/faq.md`

2. **Structure by Category**:
   ```markdown
   # Frequently Asked Questions

   ## Features & Capabilities

   ### What is entropy-based complexity analysis?

   Entropy analysis uses information theory to distinguish between genuinely complex code and repetitive pattern-based code. Traditional cyclomatic complexity counts branches, but not all branches are equal...

   [Read more in Why Debtmap?](why-debtmap.md#entropy-based-complexity-analysis)

   ### How does coverage integration work?

   Debtmap reads LCOV format coverage data and correlates it with code complexity...

   ### What languages are supported?

   - **Full support**: Rust (via syn), Python (via rustpython)
   - **Partial support**: JavaScript, TypeScript (via tree-sitter)
   - **Planned**: Go, Java, C/C++

   ## Comparison with Other Tools

   ### How is debtmap different from SonarQube?

   | Aspect | Debtmap | SonarQube |
   |--------|---------|-----------|
   | Speed | 10-100x faster (Rust) | Slower (JVM) |
   | Coverage Integration | ✅ Built-in LCOV | ⚠️ Enterprise only |
   | Entropy Analysis | ✅ Unique | ❌ No |

   ### Should I replace clippy with debtmap?

   No, use both! Clippy focuses on idiomatic Rust and common mistakes. Debtmap focuses on technical debt prioritization and risk assessment. They complement each other.

   ## Usage & Configuration

   ### Why don't entry points need 100% coverage?

   Entry points (main, handlers, CLI commands) are typically integration-tested rather than unit-tested...

   ### Can I use debtmap in CI/CD?

   Yes! Use the `validate` command with configured thresholds...

   ### How do I exclude test files from analysis?

   Configure ignore patterns in `.debtmap.toml`...

   ## Troubleshooting

   ### Debtmap reports false positives for my code

   Enable context-aware analysis (default in v0.2.8+)...

   ### Analysis is slow on large codebases

   Debtmap uses parallel processing, but very large monorepos may benefit from...
   ```

## Testing Strategy

### Documentation Quality Checks

**Code Example Validation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-doc-examples.sh

echo "Testing code examples in documentation..."

# Extract and test bash examples
for chapter in book/src/*.md; do
    echo "Checking $chapter"

    # Extract bash code blocks and test them
    grep -A 20 '```bash' "$chapter" | while read line; do
        if [[ $line == debtmap* ]]; then
            echo "Testing: $line"
            eval "$line" || echo "FAILED: $line"
        fi
    done
done
```

**Build Validation**:
```bash
# Ensure book builds without errors
cd book && mdbook build

# Check for broken links (if mdbook-linkcheck installed)
mdbook-linkcheck book

# Serve and visually inspect
mdbook serve --open
```

**Diagram Validation**:
- Render mermaid diagrams locally

# Markdown linting
npx markdownlint-cli 'book/src/**/*.md'
```

### User Acceptance

**Success Metrics**:
1. **Completeness**: All major features documented (entropy, coverage, tiered prioritization)
2. **Clarity**: External reviewer can complete getting-started in < 5 minutes
3. **Accuracy**: Code examples work on debtmap v0.2.8+
4. **Findability**: FAQ answers common questions (< 2 clicks to answer)

**Validation**:
- Share documentation with 3+ external reviewers (non-contributors)
- Ask reviewers to complete getting-started guide and provide feedback
- Measure time-to-understanding for key concepts (entropy, coverage-risk)
- Track FAQ coverage of actual user questions from GitHub issues

## Implementation Notes

### Code Example Best Practices

**Self-Contained Examples**:
- Use minimal, runnable examples
- Include setup context when needed
- Show expected output
- Explain any non-obvious behavior

**Example Format**:
```markdown
To analyze a Rust project with coverage:

```bash
# Generate coverage data
cargo tarpaulin --out lcov --output-dir target/coverage

# Run debtmap with coverage integration
debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info --top 5
```

This produces prioritized recommendations based on complexity-coverage correlation:

```
#1 SCORE: 8.9 [CRITICAL]
├─ TEST GAP: ./src/parser.rs:38 parse_input()
├─ ACTION: Add 6 unit tests for full coverage
...
```
```

### Architecture Diagram Guidelines

**Mermaid Syntax**:
- Use `graph TD` for top-down flow
- Label all edges with data types
- Group related components with subgraphs
- Use consistent colors for different layers

**Fallback Strategy**:
If mermaid rendering fails:
1. Export diagram as SVG using mermaid CLI
2. Store SVG in `book/images/`
3. Embed with `![Architecture](images/architecture.svg)`

### FAQ Organization

**Structure by User Journey**:
1. **Pre-adoption**: "What is this? Why should I use it?"
2. **Getting started**: "How do I install? How do I run?"
3. **Usage**: "How do I configure? How do I interpret results?"
4. **Troubleshooting**: "Why doesn't it work? How do I fix errors?"

**Answer Format**:
- Short answer (2-3 sentences)
- Link to detailed explanation
- Code example if applicable

### Drift Detection Integration

**How Drift Detection Works**:
1. `/prodigy-analyze-features-for-book` scans codebase for CLI commands, config options, metrics
2. `/prodigy-detect-documentation-gaps` compares features to book chapters
3. `/prodigy-analyze-book-chapter-drift` analyzes each chapter for outdated content
4. `/prodigy-fix-chapter-drift` updates chapters to match codebase

**Manual Validation After Drift Detection**:
- Review auto-generated content for accuracy
- Add context and examples where auto-generation is insufficient
- Ensure tone and style consistency

### Maintenance Strategy

**Keeping Documentation Current**:
- Run drift detection before each release
- Update examples when CLI changes
- Add FAQ entries for common GitHub issues
- Review architecture diagram when major refactoring occurs

**Automation Opportunities**:
- Extract CLI help text automatically
- Generate configuration reference from schema
- Auto-update version numbers in examples

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes

None. This is purely documentation enhancement.

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing documentation URLs remain valid
- New chapters integrate into existing structure
- No changes to mdbook configuration that would break builds

### Migration Path

No user migration required. Documentation improvements are immediately available after:
1. Chapters are added/updated
2. `mdbook build` is run
3. Documentation site is deployed

### Rollback Plan

If any new chapter causes issues:
- Remove chapter from `SUMMARY.md`
- Remove chapter file
- Remove entry from `debtmap-chapters.json`
- Rebuild book: `cd book && mdbook build`
