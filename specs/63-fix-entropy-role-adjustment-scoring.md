# Specification 63: Fix Entropy Dampening and Role Adjustment Scoring Issues

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [60 - Configurable Scoring Weights, 61 - Smarter Token Classification]

## Context

The current technical debt scoring system exhibits problematic interactions between entropy dampening and role adjustments, leading to:

1. **Over-dampening**: Functions with different complexities (10 vs 21) converge to nearly identical scores (5.05)
2. **Score flattening**: Entropy adjustments can reduce complexity scores by 100%, eliminating differentiation
3. **Incorrect prioritization**: Simple orchestrator functions score similarly to complex business logic
4. **Double penalties**: Functions receive both entropy dampening AND role reduction, compounding the effect

Analysis shows:
- Function #1: Complexity 10 → 7.0 (30% reduction) → 0.0 (100% dampening!)
- Function #2: Complexity 21 → 8.9 (58% reduction) → 0.0 (100% dampening!)
- Both end with final score 5.05 despite vastly different initial complexities

## Objective

Rebalance the entropy dampening and role adjustment systems to:
- Preserve meaningful score differentiation between functions of different complexities
- Apply adjustments that reflect actual code quality without over-penalizing
- Ensure technical debt prioritization accurately reflects refactoring value
- Maintain score distribution that enables effective prioritization

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Entropy Dampening Limits**
   - Cap maximum entropy dampening at 30% reduction (not 100%)
   - Apply dampening as a final adjustment, not to base complexity
   - Preserve relative complexity differences between functions
   - Ensure minimum complexity score of 50% original value

2. **Role Multiplier Rebalancing**
   - Adjust multipliers to avoid extreme penalties:
     - Pure Logic: 1.2 (from 1.5) - still prioritized but not extreme
     - Orchestrator: 0.8 (from 0.6) - reduced but not severely
     - IO Wrapper: 0.7 (from 0.5) - minor reduction
     - Entry Point: 0.9 (from 0.8) - slight reduction
     - Pattern Match: 0.6 (from 0.4) - moderate reduction
     - Unknown: 1.0 (unchanged)

3. **Calculation Order Fix**
   - Apply entropy adjustment after weighted score calculation
   - Or apply as a smaller adjustment to the final score
   - Prevent double-penalties from compounding adjustments
   - Ensure adjustments work together, not against each other

4. **Score Distribution Preservation**
   - Functions with 2x complexity difference maintain >30% score difference
   - Prevent score convergence for dissimilar functions
   - Maintain meaningful prioritization across score range
   - Ensure scores span reasonable range (1.0 - 10.0)

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Backwards Compatibility**
   - Changes must be configurable via existing config system
   - Default values should improve scoring without breaking existing workflows
   - Maintain existing score output format and ranges

2. **Performance**
   - No significant performance degradation
   - Maintain existing caching mechanisms
   - Optimize calculation order for efficiency

3. **Testability**
   - Add comprehensive tests for score calculations
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Validate score distribution across sample codebases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Maximum entropy dampening is capped at 30% reduction
- [ ] Role multipliers are adjusted to new balanced values
- [ ] Functions with 2x complexity difference maintain >30% score difference
- [ ] No function receives >50% total reduction from combined adjustments
- [ ] Entropy adjustment applies after base score calculation
- [ ] Score distribution test shows proper spread (1.0 - 10.0 range)
- [ ] Configuration allows tuning of dampening limits and multipliers
- [ ] Existing tests pass with updated scoring logic
- [ ] New tests validate proper adjustment interactions
- [ ] Documentation updated with new scoring algorithm

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Update Entropy Dampening Logic** (`src/complexity/entropy.rs`)
   ```rust
   pub fn apply_entropy_dampening(base_score: f64, entropy: &EntropyScore) -> f64 {
       let dampening = calculate_dampening_factor(entropy);
       // Cap dampening at 30% maximum reduction
       let capped_dampening = dampening.max(0.7);
       // Apply with minimum preservation
       (base_score * capped_dampening).max(base_score * 0.5)
   }
   ```

2. **Rebalance Role Multipliers** (`src/config.rs`)
   ```rust
   fn default_pure_logic_multiplier() -> f64 { 1.2 }
   fn default_orchestrator_multiplier() -> f64 { 0.8 }
   fn default_io_wrapper_multiplier() -> f64 { 0.7 }
   fn default_entry_point_multiplier() -> f64 { 0.9 }
   fn default_pattern_match_multiplier() -> f64 { 0.6 }
   ```

3. **Fix Calculation Order** (`src/priority/unified_scorer.rs`)
   ```rust
   // Calculate base score with original complexity
   let base_score = calculate_weighted_score(complexity, coverage, dependency, security);
   
   // Apply role adjustment first
   let role_adjusted = base_score * role_multiplier;
   
   // Then apply entropy dampening to final score
   let final_score = if let Some(entropy) = entropy_score {
       apply_entropy_dampening(role_adjusted, entropy)
   } else {
       role_adjusted
   };
   ```

### Architecture Changes

- Modify score calculation pipeline in `unified_scorer.rs`
- Update entropy dampening function signatures
- Add configuration for dampening limits
- Enhance role multiplier configuration

### Data Structures

```rust
pub struct EntropyConfig {
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub max_dampening: f64,  // New: maximum dampening percentage (0.3 = 30%)
    pub min_score_preservation: f64,  // New: minimum score preservation (0.5 = 50%)
    // ... existing fields
}

pub struct ScoringConfig {
    pub apply_entropy_to_final: bool,  // New: apply to final vs base score
    // ... existing fields
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

No external API changes. Internal scoring function signatures remain compatible.

## Implementation Notes

### Scoring Philosophy
The scoring system should:
1. Prioritize genuine complexity that needs refactoring
2. Avoid over-penalizing well-structured repetitive code
3. Recognize that orchestrators are valuable but lower priority
4. Maintain clear differentiation between complexity levels

### Edge Cases
- Functions with zero complexity should still get minimum scores
- Extremely high entropy (random code) should not over-dampen
- Role classification errors should not cause extreme scores
- Missing entropy data should fall back gracefully

### Configuration Guidelines
Provide sensible defaults but allow tuning for:
- Codebases with lots of generated/boilerplate code
- Projects prioritizing test coverage vs complexity
- Teams with different refactoring philosophies

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are internal to scoring algorithm

### Migration Path
1. New scoring will automatically apply on next run
2. Scores may change but relative rankings should improve
3. Configuration can restore old behavior if needed

### Compatibility Considerations
- Maintain score range of 0-10 for compatibility
- Keep existing output formats unchanged
- Preserve existing configuration structure
- Default to improved scoring without requiring config changes
