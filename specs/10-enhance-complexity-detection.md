# Specification 10: Enhance Complexity Detection with Modern Patterns

**Category**: enhancement
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: Spec 09 (Fix Complexity Calculation Bugs)

## Context

After fixing the core calculation bugs (Spec 09), we need to enhance complexity detection to handle modern programming patterns that contribute to cognitive load but aren't captured by traditional metrics:

1. **Modern Async Patterns**: async/await, promises, callbacks
2. **Functional Programming**: Higher-order functions, composition, currying
3. **Complex Expressions**: Method chains, nested ternaries, complex boolean logic
4. **Language-Specific Constructs**: Rust lifetimes, Python decorators, TypeScript generics

## Objective

Extend complexity detection beyond traditional metrics to capture modern programming patterns that increase cognitive load and maintenance difficulty.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Cognitive Complexity Enhancement**
   - Detect nested lambdas and closures
   - Identify callback chains and promise patterns
   - Recognize recursive patterns (direct and indirect)
   - Account for error handling complexity
   - Measure functional composition depth

2. **Modern Pattern Recognition**
   - Async/await complexity measurement
   - Stream processing chain detection
   - Pattern matching exhaustiveness
   - Generic type complexity
   - Macro expansion complexity (Rust)

3. **Expression Complexity**
   - Complex boolean expressions
   - Chained method calls
   - Nested ternary operators
   - Array/collection comprehensions
   - Template literal complexity

4. **Structural Complexity**
   - Class hierarchy depth
   - Interface implementation count
   - Trait bounds complexity (Rust)
   - Decorator stacking (Python)
   - Module coupling metrics

5. **Language-Specific Patterns**
   - Rust: unsafe blocks, lifetime complexity
   - Python: metaclasses, decorators, generators
   - JavaScript: prototype chains, this binding
   - TypeScript: type gymnastics, conditional types

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Accuracy**: Detect 95%+ of complexity patterns
2. **Performance**: <10ms per function analysis
3. **Consistency**: Same code produces same metrics
4. **Explainability**: Breakdown of complexity sources
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cognitive complexity correctly reflects nested structures
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity includes all branch types
- [ ] Modern async patterns properly weighted
- [ ] Functional patterns contribute to complexity
- [ ] Language-specific constructs detected
- [ ] Average complexity aligns with manual analysis
- [ ] Function counting accurately reflects codebase
- [ ] Complexity breakdown available on request
- [ ] Performance meets <10ms per function
- [ ] All complexity types documented
- [ ] Unit tests cover all pattern types
- [ ] Integration tests validate real codebases

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Fix Core Complexity Calculations**
   - Correct cyclomatic complexity to include all branch types
   - Fix cognitive complexity nesting calculations
   - Ensure proper function counting across files

2. **Add Modern Pattern Detection**
   - Detect async/await patterns
   - Identify callback chains and promises
   - Recognize functional composition patterns
   - Account for error handling complexity

3. **Enhanced AST Analysis**
   - Process nested structures correctly
   - Track nesting depth for cognitive complexity
   - Identify complex expressions and method chains

### Key Components

- **ComplexityMetrics**: Store cyclomatic, cognitive, and pattern-based complexity
- **ComplexityBreakdown**: Provide detailed explanation of complexity sources
- **PatternDetector**: Pluggable interface for detecting specific patterns
- **LanguageAnalyzer**: Language-specific complexity analysis

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Spec 09 (core bugs must be fixed first)
- **Affected Components**:
  - `src/complexity/mod.rs` - Major refactor
  - `src/complexity/cognitive.rs` - Enhancement
  - `src/complexity/cyclomatic.rs` - Bug fixes
  - `src/analyzers/*` - Update all language analyzers
  - `src/core/ast.rs` - Extend node types
- **External Dependencies**: 
  - May benefit from `syn` crate enhancements (Rust)
  - Consider `ast` module updates (Python)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test each complexity pattern individually
  - Validate nesting calculations
  - Test language-specific patterns
  - Verify breakdown accuracy

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test with known complex codebases
  - Compare with manual complexity assessment
  - Validate cross-language consistency
  - Test edge cases and corner patterns

- **Regression Tests**:
  - Ensure existing metrics still work
  - Compare before/after on sample code
  - Track metric stability over time

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Benchmark per-function analysis time
  - Test with deeply nested code
  - Measure memory usage for large ASTs

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**:
  - Document each complexity type
  - Explain calculation formulas
  - Provide pattern examples
  - Include threshold recommendations

- **User Documentation**:
  - Add complexity guide to README
  - Document new metrics and meanings
  - Provide interpretation guidelines
  - Include refactoring suggestions

- **Architecture Updates**:
  - Update ARCHITECTURE.md with new design
  - Document pattern detection approach
  - Add complexity type reference

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order

1. Fix existing calculation bugs (cyclomatic and cognitive)
2. Add modern pattern detection (async, callbacks, functional)
3. Enhance language-specific analysis

### Validation

- Compare results with manual analysis
- Test against known complex codebases
- Ensure consistency across languages
