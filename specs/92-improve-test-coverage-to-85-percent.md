# Specification 92: Improve Test Coverage to 85 Percent

**Category**: testing
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Current test coverage stands at 71.46% with 11,492 uncovered lines across the codebase. Of the 224 Rust source files, only 125 have test modules, leaving 99 files completely untested. Coverage is a major factor in the technical debt scoring algorithm, and improving it from 71% to 85% could reduce the debt score by approximately 100 points. Additionally, better test coverage will improve code reliability and make future refactoring safer.

## Objective

Increase overall test coverage from 71.46% to 85% by systematically adding tests to uncovered code, prioritizing high-impact modules and pure functions that are easier to test.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Achieve minimum 85% line coverage across the codebase
- Ensure all critical path code has at least 90% coverage
- Add test modules to all files currently lacking them
- Focus on testing pure functions and core business logic
- Maintain or improve test execution time

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Tests must be maintainable and well-documented
- Follow existing test patterns and conventions
- Use property-based testing where appropriate
- Minimize test flakiness and non-determinism
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in parallel

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Overall test coverage reaches 85% as measured by tarpaulin
- [ ] All 99 files without test modules have tests added
- [ ] Core modules achieve 90%+ coverage:
  - [ ] `src/analyzers/rust.rs`
  - [ ] `src/scoring/enhanced_scorer.rs`
  - [ ] `src/complexity/entropy.rs`
  - [ ] `src/config.rs`
- [ ] No increase in test execution time beyond 10%
- [ ] All new tests pass consistently (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Coverage report is integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Technical debt score reduces by at least 80 points

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Phase 1: Coverage Analysis** (Week 1)
   - Generate detailed coverage reports by module
   - Identify completely untested files
   - Prioritize based on complexity and importance
   - Create coverage improvement roadmap

2. **Phase 2: Pure Function Testing** (Week 2)
   - Target pure functions first (easier to test)
   - Add unit tests for all utility functions
   - Test data transformation and calculation logic
   - Use property-based testing for algorithmic code

3. **Phase 3: Core Module Testing** (Week 3)
   - Add comprehensive tests for analyzers
   - Test scoring and complexity calculations
   - Cover configuration and validation logic
   - Test error handling paths

4. **Phase 4: Integration Testing** (Week 4)
   - Add integration tests for module interactions
   - Test end-to-end workflows
   - Cover edge cases and error scenarios
   - Validate performance characteristics

### Testing Patterns

```rust
// Standard unit test pattern
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use pretty_assertions::assert_eq;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_pure_function() {
        let input = TestData::default();
        let expected = ExpectedOutput::new();
        let actual = function_under_test(input);
        assert_eq!(actual, expected);
    }
    
    // Property-based testing
    #[quickcheck]
    fn prop_function_preserves_invariant(input: ArbitraryInput) -> bool {
        let result = function_under_test(input);
        verify_invariant(&result)
    }
    
    // Parameterized tests
    #[test_case(0, 0 ; "zero case")]
    #[test_case(1, 1 ; "identity")]
    #[test_case(5, 120 ; "factorial five")]
    fn test_factorial(input: u32, expected: u32) {
        assert_eq!(factorial(input), expected);
    }
}
```

### Priority Files for Testing

1. **Completely Untested** (add test modules):
   - Files in `src/analysis/attribution/`
   - Files in `src/analyzers/javascript/`
   - Files in `src/cache/`
   - Files in `src/risk/`

2. **Low Coverage** (improve existing tests):
   - `src/analyzers/context_aware.rs` (73%)
   - `src/analyzers/function_registry.rs` (73%)
   - `src/config.rs` (74%)
   - `src/complexity/entropy.rs` (75%)

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**: All modules requiring tests
- **External Dependencies**: 
  - May need to add `mockall` for mocking
  - Consider adding `proptest` for property-based testing
  - Add `test-case` for parameterized tests

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test module interactions
- **Property Tests**: Use for algorithmic and mathematical functions
- **Snapshot Tests**: For complex output validation
- **Benchmark Tests**: Ensure no performance regression

## Documentation Requirements

- **Test Documentation**: Each test should have a clear description
- **Coverage Reports**: Generate and publish HTML coverage reports
- **Testing Guide**: Create guide for writing tests in this project
- **CI Integration**: Document coverage requirements in CI

## Implementation Notes

1. **Testing Utilities**:
   - Create test fixture generators
   - Build test data factories
   - Implement custom assertions
   - Add test helper functions

2. **Coverage Tools**:
   ```bash
   # Run with coverage
   cargo tarpaulin --out Html --output-dir coverage
   
   # Check coverage threshold
   cargo tarpaulin --print-summary --fail-under 85
   ```

3. **Incremental Approach**:
   - Set weekly coverage targets: 74% → 77% → 81% → 85%
   - Review and merge tests incrementally
   - Run coverage checks in CI for each PR

4. **Test Quality Metrics**:
   - Mutation testing to verify test effectiveness
   - Code review for test quality
   - Monitor test execution time
   - Track test flakiness

## Migration and Compatibility

- No breaking changes to existing code
- Existing tests remain unchanged
- New tests follow existing patterns
- Gradual rollout with coverage targets
