# Specification 25: Intelligent Refactoring Guidance System with Functional Programming Focus

**Category**: foundation
**Priority**: critical
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [19 - Unified Debt Prioritization, 23 - Enhanced Call Graph Analysis, 24 - Refined Risk Scoring Methodology]

## Context

Current debtmap analysis suffers from two fundamental flaws:

1. **Confusing Terminology**: The distinction between "Extract sub-functions" (for ComplexityHotspot) and "Extract pure functions" (for Risk) creates unnecessary confusion. Both should emphasize extracting pure functions, with the difference being the depth of functional transformation applied.

2. **Lack of Pattern Understanding**: It detects problems without understanding code patterns or providing actionable guidance, leading to:
   - Valid patterns (I/O wrappers, trait implementations) flagged as "technical debt"
   - Generic advice like "address technical debt" or "reduce complexity"
   - Users knowing something is flagged but not how to improve it
   - Cannot distinguish between genuinely problematic code and well-structured code

Additionally, the current system uses arbitrary complexity thresholds (e.g., cyclomatic > 10) to determine fundamentally different refactoring approaches, when the real distinction should be the depth of transformation needed, not the purity of extracted functions.

## Objective

Transform debtmap from a generic "technical debt detector" into an **intelligent functional refactoring advisor** that:

1. **Always recommends pure function extraction** regardless of complexity level
2. **Adjusts transformation depth** based on complexity severity (not function purity)
3. **Emphasizes functional programming patterns** over object-oriented approaches
4. **Provides specific, actionable guidance** toward a functional core / imperative shell architecture
5. **Educates developers** on functional programming benefits and techniques

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Pattern Recognition System**
   - Identify common code patterns (I/O orchestration, pure logic, formatting, etc.)
   - Recognize functional vs imperative patterns
   - Distinguish between "working code" and "code that could be functionally improved"
   - Classify function roles and expected characteristics

2. **Functional Refactoring Detection**
   - **Always prioritize pure function extraction** for any complexity level
   - Identify opportunities to convert imperative code to functional style
   - Detect side effects that can be moved to boundaries
   - Find opportunities for function composition and pipelines
   - Recognize where monadic patterns could improve error handling

3. **Complexity-Based Transformation Guidance**
   - **Low Complexity (≤5)**: No refactoring needed
   - **Moderate Complexity (6-10)**: Direct functional transformation
     - Extract 2-3 pure functions
     - Apply map/filter/fold patterns
     - Convert loops to functional operations
   - **High Complexity (11-15)**: Decompose then transform
     - Extract 3-5 pure functions
     - Apply functional patterns after decomposition
     - Create function composition pipelines
   - **Severe Complexity (>15)**: Architectural refactoring
     - Extract 5+ pure functions into modules
     - Design functional core with imperative shell
     - Consider introducing monadic patterns

4. **Functional Programming Guidance**
   - Always recommend pure functions (no side effects)
   - Prefer immutable data transformations
   - Suggest functional patterns (map, filter, fold, compose)
   - Guide toward functional core / imperative shell architecture
   - Recommend property-based testing for pure functions

5. **Educational Functional Insights**
   - Explain benefits of pure functions (testability, composability, reasoning)
   - Demonstrate functional refactoring techniques with examples
   - Show how to identify and extract side effects
   - Teach functional patterns incrementally
   - Provide resources for learning functional programming

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Accuracy**: 95% of recommendations should be genuinely helpful
2. **Actionability**: Every recommendation includes specific steps
3. **Educational Value**: Output helps developers learn better patterns
4. **Performance**: Pattern analysis adds <15% to total analysis time

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **All complexity-based recommendations suggest extracting pure functions** (no more "sub-functions" terminology)
- [ ] Complexity thresholds determine transformation depth, not function purity
- [ ] Pattern recognition identifies functional vs imperative code patterns
- [ ] Valid functional patterns recognized and praised as good examples
- [ ] Specific functional refactoring techniques suggested for each complexity level
- [ ] Clear explanations of functional programming benefits (testability, composability, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with existing scoring maintains functional programming preference
- [ ] Reduced false positive rate by 85% compared to current system
- [ ] Output includes functional "before/after" transformation examples
- [ ] Educational content teaches functional programming incrementally
- [ ] Performance impact under 15% of total analysis time
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite validates functional refactoring recommendations

## Technical Details

### Functional Programming Philosophy

This specification establishes a **strong preference for functional programming** in all refactoring recommendations:

1. **Pure Functions First**: Every extracted function should be pure (no side effects) unless handling I/O at boundaries
2. **Immutability by Default**: Prefer immutable data transformations over in-place mutations
3. **Composition Over Complexity**: Build complex behavior by composing simple, pure functions
4. **Functional Core, Imperative Shell**: Keep business logic pure, isolate I/O at boundaries
5. **Unified Terminology**: Always use "extract pure functions" regardless of complexity level

The key insight is that **complexity level determines transformation depth, not function purity**:
- Moderate complexity → Direct transformation to functional style
- High complexity → Decompose first, then apply functional patterns
- Severe complexity → Architectural refactoring toward functional core

### Implementation Approach

1. **Pattern Recognition Engine**
```rust
pub struct PatternRecognitionEngine {
    pattern_matchers: Vec<Box<dyn PatternMatcher>>,
    function_classifier: FunctionRoleClassifier,
    refactoring_advisor: RefactoringAdvisor,
}

impl PatternRecognitionEngine {
    pub fn analyze_function(&self, function: &FunctionAnalysis) -> AnalysisResult {
        let role = self.function_classifier.classify(function);
        let patterns = self.identify_patterns(function);
        let opportunities = self.find_refactoring_opportunities(function, &role, &patterns);
        
        AnalysisResult {
            function_role: role,
            detected_patterns: patterns,
            refactoring_opportunities: opportunities,
            quality_assessment: self.assess_quality(function, &patterns),
            recommendations: self.generate_recommendations(&opportunities),
        }
    }
    
    fn identify_patterns(&self, function: &FunctionAnalysis) -> Vec<DetectedPattern> {
        self.pattern_matchers
            .iter()
            .filter_map(|matcher| matcher.match_pattern(function))
            .collect()
    }
}
```

2. **Function Role Classification**
```rust
pub enum FunctionRole {
    PureLogic {
        complexity_tolerance: u32,
        testing_expectation: TestingExpectation,
    },
    IOOrchestrator {
        expected_patterns: Vec<OrchestrationPattern>,
        complexity_tolerance: u32,
    },
    FormattingFunction {
        input_types: Vec<Type>,
        output_type: Type,
        testability_importance: TestabilityImportance,
    },
    TraitImplementation {
        trait_name: String,
        testing_strategy: TraitTestingStrategy,
    },
    FrameworkCallback {
        framework: Framework,
        callback_type: CallbackType,
    },
}

pub struct FunctionRoleClassifier {
    io_detectors: Vec<IoDetector>,
    formatting_detectors: Vec<FormattingDetector>,
    trait_analyzers: Vec<TraitAnalyzer>,
}

impl FunctionRoleClassifier {
    pub fn classify(&self, function: &FunctionAnalysis) -> FunctionRole {
        // Priority order matters - most specific first
        if let Some(trait_info) = self.detect_trait_implementation(function) {
            return FunctionRole::TraitImplementation {
                trait_name: trait_info.trait_name,
                testing_strategy: TraitTestingStrategy::TestThroughCallers,
            };
        }
        
        if let Some(io_info) = self.detect_io_orchestration(function) {
            return FunctionRole::IOOrchestrator {
                expected_patterns: io_info.patterns,
                complexity_tolerance: 5, // I/O functions can be more complex
            };
        }
        
        if let Some(formatting_info) = self.detect_formatting_function(function) {
            return FunctionRole::FormattingFunction {
                input_types: formatting_info.inputs,
                output_type: formatting_info.output,
                testability_importance: TestabilityImportance::High,
            };
        }
        
        // Default to pure logic with strict expectations
        FunctionRole::PureLogic {
            complexity_tolerance: 3,
            testing_expectation: TestingExpectation::HighCoverage,
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Refactoring Opportunity Detection**

pub struct RefactoringAdvisor {
    opportunity_detectors: Vec<Box<dyn RefactoringDetector>>,
    pattern_library: PatternLibrary,
}

pub trait RefactoringDetector {
    fn detect_opportunities(&self, function: &FunctionAnalysis, role: &FunctionRole) -> Vec<RefactoringOpportunity>;
    fn priority(&self) -> Priority;
}

pub struct ExtractFormattingDetector;
impl RefactoringDetector for ExtractFormattingDetector {
    fn detect_opportunities(&self, function: &FunctionAnalysis, role: &FunctionRole) -> Vec<RefactoringOpportunity> {
        if let FunctionRole::IOOrchestrator { .. } = role {
            if self.has_embedded_formatting_logic(function) {
                return vec![RefactoringOpportunity::ExtractFormattingLogic {
                    current_function: function.name.clone(),
                    suggested_pure_function: self.suggest_formatting_function_name(function),
                    benefits: vec![
                        "Formatting logic becomes unit testable",
                        "I/O function becomes simpler and more focused",
                        "Formatting can be reused in other contexts",
                    ],
                    technique: RefactoringTechnique::ExtractMethod,
                    effort_estimate: EffortEstimate::Low,
                    example: self.generate_before_after_example(function),
                }];
            }
        }
        vec![]
    }
}

pub struct SeparateConcernsDetector;
impl RefactoringDetector for SeparateConcernsDetector {
    fn detect_opportunities(&self, function: &FunctionAnalysis, role: &FunctionRole) -> Vec<RefactoringOpportunity> {
        if matches!(role, FunctionRole::IOOrchestrator { .. }) {
            let business_logic_blocks = self.find_business_logic_blocks(function);
            if !business_logic_blocks.is_empty() {
                return vec![RefactoringOpportunity::SeparateConcerns {
                    mixed_function: function.name.clone(),
                    business_logic_blocks,
                    suggested_pure_functions: self.suggest_extracted_functions(&business_logic_blocks),
                    benefits: vec![
                        "Business logic becomes testable without I/O mocking",
                        "Clearer separation of concerns",
                        "Logic can be reused independently",
                    ],
                    technique: RefactoringTechnique::ExtractClass,
                    effort_estimate: EffortEstimate::Medium,
                }];
            }
        }

        }
    }
    
    fn format_good_example(&self, result: &AnalysisResult) -> FormattedOutput {
        FormattedOutput {
            status: OutputStatus::GoodExample,
            title: format!("✓ Good Example: {}", result.function_name),
            explanation: self.explain_why_good(result),
            role_context: self.explain_role(&result.function_role),

        }
    }

## Example: Old vs New Approach

### Current System (Confusing)

For a function with cyclomatic complexity 9:
```
RISK: function_name()
ACTION: Extract 2 pure functions to reduce complexity from 9 to 3
```

For a function with cyclomatic complexity 11:
```
COMPLEXITY: function_name()
ACTION: Extract 2 sub-functions to reduce complexity
```

**Problem**: Why are we extracting "pure functions" for complexity 9 but "sub-functions" for complexity 11?

### New System (Clear and Consistent)

For a function with cyclomatic complexity 9:
```
MODERATE COMPLEXITY: function_name()
ACTION: Extract 3 pure functions using direct functional transformation
PATTERNS: Replace loops with map/filter/fold, extract predicates, compose functions
BENEFIT: Pure functions are easily testable and composable
```

For a function with cyclomatic complexity 11:
```
HIGH COMPLEXITY: function_name()
ACTION: Extract 4 pure functions using decompose-then-transform strategy
PATTERNS: First decompose into logical units, then apply functional patterns
BENEFIT: Reduces complexity while maintaining functional purity
```

**Solution**: Always extract pure functions; complexity only affects the transformation strategy.

## Migration and Compatibility

- **Non-Breaking Changes**:
  - New analysis is addition to existing functionality
  - Existing CLI flags and basic output preserved
  - Enhanced output provides more detail

- **Output Evolution**:
  - Current generic debt items become specific guidance
  - New explanation fields added to output formats
  - Optional verbose mode for detailed pattern analysis

- **User Adoption**:
  - Migration guide from old to new interpretations
  - Side-by-side comparison of old vs. new analysis
  - Training materials for understanding new guidance

## Expected Impact

1. **Terminology Clarity**: 100% consistent use of "extract pure functions" terminology
2. **False Positive Reduction**: 85% fewer irrelevant warnings
3. **Functional Adoption**: Teams naturally adopt functional programming patterns
4. **Code Testability**: Extracted pure functions are easily unit tested
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Clear separation of pure logic from side effects
6. **Developer Education**: Teams learn functional programming incrementally
7. **Actionability**: Every recommendation includes specific functional transformation steps
8. **Code Quality**: Measurable improvement toward functional core / imperative shell architecture

This specification transforms debtmap from a problem detector into a **functional programming mentor**, guiding development teams to write more maintainable, testable, and composable code through consistent application of functional programming principles. The key innovation is recognizing that all functions should be pure by default, with complexity only determining how deep the functional transformation should go.
