# Specification 134: Fix God Object Metric Contradictions

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: critical
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

The current god object detection in debtmap produces contradictory metrics that undermine user trust and actionability. For example, in the ripgrep analysis, `standard.rs` shows:
- "172 functions" in the main description
- "94 total (0 public, 0 private)" in the structure breakdown
- Claims "1 responsibility" but also "10 responsibilities across 17 components"

These contradictions make it impossible for users to:
1. Trust the analysis results
2. Understand the actual scope of the problem
3. Take meaningful action based on the recommendations

## Objective

Eliminate all metric contradictions in god object detection and ensure all reported numbers are consistent, accurate, and clearly explained.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Function Count Consistency**
   - Single source of truth for function counting
   - Consistent counting methodology across all reporting sections
   - Clear distinction between module functions, impl functions, trait implementations, and associated functions
   - Reconcile discrepancies between different analysis phases

2. **Visibility Metrics Accuracy**
   - Correctly count and report public vs private functions
   - Never report "0 public, 0 private" when functions exist
   - Handle Rust visibility modifiers correctly (pub, pub(crate), pub(super), private)
   - Account for re-exports and trait implementations

3. **Responsibility Counting Consistency**
   - Single, well-defined algorithm for counting responsibilities
   - Consistent reporting across all output sections
   - Clear mapping between responsibility count and the actual responsibilities identified
   - No contradictions between summary and detailed breakdowns

4. **Data Flow Integrity**
   - Ensure metrics calculated during analysis match metrics reported in output
   - Validate metric consistency before generating reports
   - Add internal consistency checks that fail loudly if contradictions detected

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Traceability**: All metrics should be traceable to their source calculation
2. **Testability**: Unit tests should validate metric consistency across different code paths
3. **Clarity**: Each metric should have clear documentation explaining what it counts and how
4. **Performance**: Consistency checks should not significantly impact analysis speed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Function count is identical across all reporting sections for the same file
- [ ] Public/private function counts always sum to total function count
- [ ] Never report "0 public, 0 private" when functions exist
- [ ] Responsibility count is consistent between summary and detailed breakdowns
- [ ] Each reported responsibility has a clear, named identity (not just a count)
- [ ] All contradictions in the ripgrep standard.rs analysis are resolved
- [ ] Internal consistency validation fails analysis if metrics don't reconcile
- [ ] Unit tests verify metric consistency for known test cases
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains each metric and how it's calculated
- [ ] Integration test with ripgrep shows no contradictions in output

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Create Unified Metrics Structure**
   ```rust
   pub struct GodObjectMetrics {
       total_functions: usize,
       public_functions: usize,
       private_functions: usize,
       responsibilities: Vec<NamedResponsibility>,
       components: Vec<ComponentMetrics>,
   }

   impl GodObjectMetrics {
       pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<(), MetricInconsistency> {
           // Enforce: public + private = total
           // Enforce: component functions sum to total
           // Enforce: responsibilities.len() matches reported count
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Single Counting Pass**
   - Perform all function counting in a single, well-defined phase
   - Store results in unified metrics structure
   - Validate consistency immediately after calculation
   - Pass validated metrics to all output formatters

3. **Explicit Responsibility Identification**
   - Name each responsibility based on analysis (not generic numbering)
   - Map functions to specific responsibilities
   - Ensure responsibility count matches number of named responsibilities

4. **Output Formatter Constraints**
   - Output formatters MUST use metrics structure directly
   - No recalculation or reinterpretation of metrics in formatters
   - Read-only access to metrics in output phase

### Root Cause Analysis

Investigate and fix:
1. Where do the different function counts come from? (172 vs 94)
2. Why does visibility counting produce "0 public, 0 private"?
3. What causes responsibility count contradictions? (1 vs 10)
4. Are there multiple code paths calculating the same metrics differently?

### Data Structures

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct NamedResponsibility {
    name: String,              // e.g., "Input Validation", "Data Transformation"
    functions: Vec<String>,    // Functions belonging to this responsibility
    description: String,       // What this responsibility does
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ComponentMetrics {
    name: String,
    function_count: usize,
    line_count: usize,
    visibility: FunctionVisibility,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct FunctionVisibility {
    public: usize,
    pub_crate: usize,
    pub_super: usize,
    private: usize,
}

impl FunctionVisibility {
    pub fn total(&self) -> usize {
        self.public + self.pub_crate + self.pub_super + self.private
    }
}
```

### Validation Strategy

```rust
pub fn validate_god_object_metrics(metrics: &GodObjectMetrics) -> Result<()> {
    // Rule 1: Visibility breakdown must sum to total
    let vis_total = metrics.public_functions + metrics.private_functions;
    ensure!(vis_total == metrics.total_functions,
            "Visibility count mismatch: {} + {} != {}",
            metrics.public_functions, metrics.private_functions, metrics.total_functions);

    // Rule 2: Component functions must sum to total
    let component_total: usize = metrics.components.iter()
        .map(|c| c.function_count)
        .sum();
    ensure!(component_total == metrics.total_functions,
            "Component function count mismatch: {} != {}",
            component_total, metrics.total_functions);

    // Rule 3: Responsibility count must match named responsibilities
    ensure!(!metrics.responsibilities.is_empty() || metrics.total_functions == 0,
            "Non-zero functions but no responsibilities identified");

    Ok(())
}
```

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**:
  - `src/debt/god_object.rs` - God object detection logic
  - `src/io/output.rs` - Output formatting
  - `src/analysis/module_metrics.rs` - Module-level analysis
- **External Dependencies**: None (uses existing anyhow for error handling)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_function_count_consistency() {
    let source = r#"
        pub fn public_func() {}
        fn private_func() {}
        pub(crate) fn crate_func() {}
    "#;

    let metrics = analyze_god_object(source).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(metrics.total_functions, 3);
    assert_eq!(metrics.public_functions + metrics.private_functions, 3);
    assert!(metrics.validate().is_ok());
}

#[test]
fn test_responsibility_naming() {
    let metrics = analyze_test_file("god_object_sample.rs");
    assert!(!metrics.responsibilities.is_empty());
    for resp in metrics.responsibilities {
        assert!(!resp.name.is_empty());
        assert!(!resp.functions.is_empty());
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_ripgrep_standard_rs_consistency() {
    // Regression test for the specific file that showed contradictions
    let metrics = analyze_file("../ripgrep/crates/printer/src/standard.rs").unwrap();

    // Should not have contradictions
    assert!(metrics.validate().is_ok());

    // Should have consistent function counts in all output
    let output = format_god_object_issue(&metrics);
    assert!(!output.contains("0 public, 0 private"));

    // Extract all function count mentions and verify they match
    let counts = extract_function_counts(&output);
    assert!(counts.iter().all(|&c| c == metrics.total_functions));
}
```

### Property-Based Tests

```rust
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn metrics_always_consistent(functions in valid_rust_functions(0..200)) {
        let metrics = calculate_metrics(&functions);
        prop_assert!(metrics.validate().is_ok());
    }
}
```

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation

- Document the `GodObjectMetrics` structure and each field's meaning
- Explain the counting methodology for each metric type
- Document the validation rules and why they exist
- Add examples showing correct metric calculation

### User Documentation

- Update output format documentation to explain each metric
- Clarify what "responsibility" means in god object detection
- Explain the difference between public and private function counts
- Provide examples of consistent vs inconsistent metrics

### Architecture Updates

Update ARCHITECTURE.md to document:
- Metric calculation pipeline and validation points
- Single source of truth principle for metrics
- Consistency enforcement strategy

## Implementation Notes

### Investigation Steps

1. **Trace Function Counting**
   - Add debug logging to all places that count functions
   - Identify all code paths that produce function counts
   - Find where the 172 vs 94 discrepancy originates

2. **Review Responsibility Detection**
   - Understand current responsibility detection algorithm
   - Identify why counts are inconsistent
   - Determine if "1 vs 10" is a display bug or calculation bug

3. **Fix Visibility Counting**
   - Review how `syn` AST is parsed for visibility
   - Check if `pub(crate)` and `pub(super)` are handled
   - Fix the "0 public, 0 private" bug

### Common Pitfalls

- **Double Counting**: Ensure trait implementations aren't counted multiple times
- **Macro Expansion**: Be careful with macro-generated functions
- **Nested Items**: Properly handle functions within functions (closures)
- **Associated Functions**: Distinguish between methods and associated functions

### Debugging Approach

If contradictions persist:
1. Add comprehensive logging at each metric calculation point
2. Create minimal reproduction case
3. Use property-based testing to find edge cases
4. Validate assumptions about AST structure

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes

- Output format may change if we add more detailed visibility breakdown
- Error reporting: analysis may now fail with validation errors for inconsistent metrics

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing JSON/YAML output formats should remain compatible
- Add new optional fields rather than changing existing ones
- Internal validation errors should provide clear upgrade guidance

### Migration Path

1. Add validation but make it a warning initially
2. Fix all known contradictions in our test suite
3. Make validation errors fail the analysis in next minor version
4. Document the new consistency guarantees

## Success Metrics

- Zero contradiction errors in our integration test suite
- All ripgrep analysis shows consistent metrics
- User confidence in god object detection improves (measured by issue reports)
- Analysis reliability increases (fewer false positives from bad metrics)
