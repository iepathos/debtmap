# Specification 74: Python Test Quality Analysis

**Category**: testing
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

The Rust analyzer includes sophisticated test quality analysis including detection of tests without assertions, overly complex tests, and flaky test patterns. It also provides test simplification suggestions and reliability assessments. The Python analyzer only has basic test detection (checking for `test_` prefix) without any quality analysis. This gap prevents identifying problematic test patterns that impact code reliability and maintenance.

Test quality issues include:
- Tests without meaningful assertions
- Overly complex test logic
- Time-dependent or non-deterministic tests
- Excessive mocking or setup
- Poor test isolation

Python's unittest, pytest, and other frameworks have specific patterns that need specialized detection.

## Objective

Implement comprehensive test quality analysis for Python that matches the Rust analyzer's capabilities, detecting test anti-patterns, complexity issues, and providing actionable improvement suggestions for Python test code.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Detect tests without assertions (all frameworks)
- Identify overly complex test functions
- Find flaky test patterns (timing, randomness, external deps)
- Detect excessive mocking or patching
- Identify poor test isolation patterns
- Support unittest, pytest, nose, and doctest
- Provide test simplification suggestions
- Calculate test complexity metrics

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Framework-agnostic detection where possible
- Accurate framework-specific pattern recognition
- Minimal performance impact on analysis
- Configurable complexity thresholds

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PythonTestAnalyzer implementation
- [ ] Assertion detection for all major frameworks
- [ ] Test complexity scoring algorithm
- [ ] Flaky pattern detection rules
- [ ] Mock/patch complexity analysis
- [ ] Test isolation validation
- [ ] Framework detection (unittest, pytest, etc.)
- [ ] Simplification suggestion generation
- [ ] Integration with Python analyzer
- [ ] Configuration for thresholds
- [ ] Unit tests for each pattern
- [ ] Documentation of test patterns

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. Create `testing::python` module
2. Implement framework detection logic
3. Build assertion pattern matchers
4. Create complexity analyzers for tests
5. Implement flakiness detectors
6. Integrate with Python function analysis

### Architecture Changes
- New module: `src/testing/python/`
- Framework-specific detectors
- Test pattern analysis integration

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct PythonTestAnalyzer {
    framework: TestFramework,
    assertion_patterns: Vec<AssertionPattern>,
    complexity_threshold: u32,
}

pub enum TestFramework {
    Unittest,
    Pytest,
    Nose,
    Doctest,
    Unknown,
}

pub struct TestQualityIssue {
    pub issue_type: TestIssueType,
    pub test_name: String,
    pub severity: Severity,
    pub suggestion: String,
}

pub enum TestIssueType {
    NoAssertions,
    OverlyComplex(u32),
    FlakyPattern(FlakinessType),
    ExcessiveMocking(usize),
    PoorIsolation,
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces
- `PythonTestAnalyzer::analyze_test(func_def: &ast::StmtFunctionDef) -> Vec<TestQualityIssue>`
- Integration with function metrics extraction
- Test quality scoring API

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**: 
  - `src/analyzers/python.rs`
  - `src/testing/mod.rs`
  - `src/core/metrics.rs`
- **External Dependencies**: rustpython_parser (existing)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Each detection pattern
- **Framework Tests**: unittest, pytest, nose specific
- **Integration Tests**: Full test file analysis
- **Validation Tests**: Known good/bad test patterns

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Detection algorithms
- **User Documentation**: Test quality metrics interpretation
- **Best Practices**: Python testing guidelines
- **Examples**: Good vs problematic test patterns

## Implementation Notes

- Handle pytest fixtures and parametrization
- Detect unittest assert methods
- Support pytest plain assert statements
- Handle async test functions
- Consider setup/teardown complexity
- Account for test decorators and markers
- Special handling for doctest patterns

## Migration and Compatibility

During prototype phase: New feature addition with no breaking changes. Test quality metrics will be added alongside existing test detection without modifying current behavior.
