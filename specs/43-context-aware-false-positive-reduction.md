# Specification 43: Context-Aware False Positive Reduction

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: critical
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [28, 31, 34, 35, 41]

## Context

The product analysis revealed that debtmap generates many false positives, particularly for:
- Blocking I/O in appropriate contexts (main functions, config loading, test functions)
- Input validation warnings in test code with literal strings
- Performance issues in code where performance doesn't matter
- Security warnings for test fixtures and mock data

These false positives reduce user trust and make it harder to identify genuine technical debt. The tool needs context-aware rules to understand when certain patterns are acceptable versus problematic.

## Objective

Implement context-aware detection rules that dramatically reduce false positives by understanding the purpose and context of code, distinguishing between production and test code, and recognizing framework patterns where certain "anti-patterns" are actually appropriate.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Context Classification System**
   - Classify functions by their role: main(), config loader, test function, handler, utility
   - Identify file types: production code, test files, benchmarks, examples, documentation
   - Recognize framework patterns: CLI entry points, web handlers, test fixtures

2. **Context-Aware Rules Engine**
   - Define rules that consider function context when evaluating patterns
   - Support rule precedence and overrides based on context
   - Allow patterns that are normally "bad" in appropriate contexts

3. **Test Code Recognition**
   - Automatically detect test modules and functions
   - Apply different rules for test code vs production code
   - Exclude test code from certain security and performance checks

4. **I/O Context Analysis**
   - Identify synchronous vs asynchronous contexts
   - Recognize appropriate blocking I/O usage (CLI tools, config loading)
   - Detect actual async boundaries where blocking I/O is problematic

5. **Framework Pattern Recognition**
   - Detect common framework patterns (Rust's main(), Python's __main__)
   - Recognize web framework handlers, CLI command handlers
   - Identify configuration and initialization code

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance Impact**
   - Context analysis should add less than 5% to analysis time
   - Rules evaluation should be cached where possible
   - Pattern matching should use efficient algorithms

2. **Configurability**
   - Allow users to define custom context patterns
   - Support enabling/disabling specific context rules
   - Provide profiles for different project types (CLI, web, library)

3. **Backwards Compatibility**
   - Maintain existing API and CLI interfaces
   - Provide migration path for existing configurations
   - Default to current behavior with opt-in to context awareness

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Blocking I/O in main() functions is not flagged as technical debt
- [ ] Config loading functions are not flagged for synchronous I/O
- [ ] Test functions are not flagged for input validation with literals
- [ ] Test code security warnings are deprioritized or excluded
- [ ] Framework initialization patterns are recognized and handled appropriately
- [ ] False positive rate reduced by at least 60% on debtmap's own codebase
- [ ] Context rules are configurable via configuration file
- [ ] Performance impact is less than 5% on large codebases
- [ ] All existing tests pass with context awareness enabled
- [ ] Documentation includes context pattern configuration examples

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Context Detection Module**
   ```rust
   pub struct FunctionContext {
       pub role: FunctionRole,
       pub file_type: FileType,
       pub is_async: bool,
       pub framework_pattern: Option<FrameworkPattern>,
   }
   
   pub enum FunctionRole {
       Main,
       ConfigLoader,
       TestFunction,
       Handler,
       Utility,
       Unknown,
   }
   ```

2. **Rules Engine Integration**
   - Modify existing detectors to accept FunctionContext
   - Add context-based filtering before creating debt items
   - Implement rule precedence system

3. **Pattern Matching System**
   - Use regex patterns for function name matching
   - AST analysis for structural pattern recognition
   - Module path analysis for test detection

### Architecture Changes

1. Add `context` module for context detection
2. Modify detector interfaces to accept context information
3. Add context cache to avoid repeated analysis
4. Integrate with existing suppression system

### Data Structures

```rust
pub struct ContextRule {
    pub pattern: Pattern,
    pub context: FunctionContext,
    pub action: RuleAction,
    pub priority: i32,
}

pub enum RuleAction {
    Allow,      // Pattern is acceptable in this context
    Warn,       // Reduce severity
    Deny,       // Flag as debt (default)
    Skip,       // Don't analyze
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

```rust
pub trait ContextAware {
    fn analyze_with_context(
        &self,
        code: &str,
        context: &FunctionContext,
    ) -> Vec<DebtItem>;
}
```

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Spec 28: Security Patterns Detection (for security context rules)
  - Spec 31: Testing Quality Patterns (for test detection)
  - Spec 34: Error Swallowing Detection (for context-aware error handling)
  - Spec 35: Debt Pattern Unified Scoring (for integration)
  - Spec 41: Test Performance Configuration (for test file handling)

- **Affected Components**:
  - All detector modules
  - Priority scoring system
  - Configuration system
  - CLI interface

- **External Dependencies**: None

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Context detection for various function types
  - Rule matching and precedence
  - Pattern recognition accuracy

- **Integration Tests**:
  - False positive reduction on sample codebases
  - Performance benchmarks with context analysis
  - Configuration loading and rule application

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure overhead of context analysis
  - Cache effectiveness metrics
  - Large codebase performance

- **User Acceptance**:
  - Run on real projects to validate false positive reduction
  - Gather feedback on remaining false positives
  - Validate context pattern recognition accuracy

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**:
  - Document context detection algorithms
  - Explain rule precedence and matching
  - Provide examples of context patterns

- **User Documentation**:
  - Configuration guide for context rules
  - Examples of custom context patterns
  - Migration guide from non-context-aware analysis

- **Architecture Updates**:
  - Update ARCHITECTURE.md with context module
  - Document integration with detector system
  - Explain caching strategy

## Implementation Notes

1. Start with the most common false positives (blocking I/O, test code)
2. Build incrementally - add context types as needed
3. Make the system extensible for future context types
4. Consider machine learning for pattern recognition in future
5. Ensure context detection is language-agnostic where possible

## Migration and Compatibility

- Context awareness is opt-in via `--context-aware` flag initially
- Configuration file supports `context_rules` section
- Existing suppressions continue to work
- Gradual migration path with warnings for deprecated patterns
- Default context rules shipped with the tool
