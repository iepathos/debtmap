# Specification 59: Reduce Entropy Dampening Impact

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [52, 53, 54, 55]

## Context

The entropy-based complexity scoring system (specs 52-54) was designed to distinguish between genuinely complex logic and repetitive pattern-based code. However, the current implementation applies overly aggressive dampening:

- High repetition (>70%): Reduces complexity by 70% (multiplier: 0.3)
- Low entropy (<0.4): Reduces complexity by 50% (multiplier: 0.5)
- Similar branches (>80%): Reduces complexity by 60% (multiplier: 0.4)

These reductions are too severe, causing:
1. **Undervalued Complexity**: Complex validation logic scored as trivial
2. **Hidden Technical Debt**: Pattern-based but problematic code becomes invisible
3. **Score Convergence**: Over-dampening contributes to all scores clustering around 5.0
4. **False Negatives**: Missing real issues in repetitive but complex code

For example, a function with cyclomatic complexity of 10 can be reduced to 3, moving it from "needs refactoring" to "acceptable" despite genuine complexity.

## Objective

Adjust entropy dampening to more moderate levels that:
- Still recognize pattern-based simplicity
- Don't hide genuine complexity
- Maintain score differentiation
- Cap maximum reduction at 30%
- Use graduated dampening rather than sharp thresholds

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Moderate Dampening Levels**
   - Maximum reduction: 30% (multiplier: 0.7 minimum)
   - High repetition (>70%): 20% reduction (multiplier: 0.8)
   - Low entropy (<0.4): 15% reduction (multiplier: 0.85)
   - Similar branches (>80%): 25% reduction (multiplier: 0.75)
   - Combined effects capped at 30% total reduction

2. **Graduated Dampening**
   - Replace sharp thresholds with smooth gradients
   - Linear interpolation between thresholds
   - No sudden jumps in complexity scores

3. **Configurable Dampening**
   - Allow users to adjust dampening strength
   - Provide conservative defaults
   - Option to disable entropy dampening entirely

4. **Improved Pattern Recognition**
   - Better distinguish between simple patterns and complex validation
   - Consider nesting depth in entropy calculation
   - Account for variable diversity in patterns

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Transparency**: Clear reporting of entropy adjustments
2. **Performance**: Maintain efficiency of entropy calculations
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing entropy scores remain valid
4. **Configurability**: Full control over dampening behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Maximum entropy dampening limited to 30%
- [ ] Graduated dampening with no sharp transitions
- [ ] Complex validation functions maintain complexity scores above 7
- [ ] Pattern matching functions get moderate reduction (15-25%)
- [ ] Configuration options for dampening strength
- [ ] Verbose mode shows entropy reasoning
- [ ] Tests verify dampening limits
- [ ] Documentation explains new dampening model
- [ ] No function gets more than 30% reduction
- [ ] Combined effects properly capped

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Update Dampening Calculation**
```rust
pub fn apply_entropy_dampening(base_complexity: u32, entropy_score: &EntropyScore) -> u32 {
    let config = get_entropy_config();
    
    if !config.enabled {
        return base_complexity;
    }
    
    // Calculate individual dampening factors (all >= 0.7)
    let repetition_factor = if entropy_score.pattern_repetition > config.pattern_threshold {
        // Graduated dampening based on repetition level
        let excess = (entropy_score.pattern_repetition - config.pattern_threshold) 
                    / (1.0 - config.pattern_threshold);
        1.0 - (excess * 0.20).min(0.20)  // Max 20% reduction
    } else {
        1.0
    };
    
    let entropy_factor = if entropy_score.token_entropy < 0.4 {
        // Graduated dampening based on entropy level
        let deficit = (0.4 - entropy_score.token_entropy) / 0.4;
        1.0 - (deficit * 0.15).min(0.15)  // Max 15% reduction
    } else {
        1.0
    };
    
    let branch_factor = if entropy_score.branch_similarity > 0.8 {
        // Graduated dampening based on branch similarity
        let excess = (entropy_score.branch_similarity - 0.8) / 0.2;
        1.0 - (excess * 0.25).min(0.25)  // Max 25% reduction
    } else {
        1.0
    };
    
    // Combine factors with cap at 30% total reduction
    let combined_factor = (repetition_factor * entropy_factor * branch_factor).max(0.7);
    
    // Apply dampening with minimum complexity preservation
    let adjusted = (base_complexity as f64 * combined_factor) as u32;
    adjusted.max(base_complexity / 2)  // Never reduce by more than 50% as safety
}
```

2. **Add Configuration Options**
```rust
pub struct EntropyConfig {
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub pattern_threshold: f64,      // Default: 0.7
    pub max_repetition_reduction: f64,  // Default: 0.20 (20%)
    pub max_entropy_reduction: f64,     // Default: 0.15 (15%)
    pub max_branch_reduction: f64,      // Default: 0.25 (25%)
    pub max_combined_reduction: f64,    // Default: 0.30 (30%)
}
```

3. **Improve Pattern Recognition**
```rust
fn calculate_pattern_complexity(entropy_score: &EntropyScore, nesting: u32) -> f64 {
    // Consider nesting depth - deeply nested patterns are more complex
    let nesting_factor = 1.0 + (nesting as f64 * 0.1);
    
    // Consider variable diversity - more variables = more complex
    let diversity_factor = 1.0 + (entropy_score.unique_variables as f64 * 0.05);
    
    // Combine with entropy for final complexity
    entropy_score.effective_complexity * nesting_factor * diversity_factor
}
```

### Architecture Changes

- Modify `entropy.rs` to implement graduated dampening
- Update configuration system for new entropy options
- Enhance entropy calculation to consider more factors

### Data Structures

Update EntropyScore to include more context:
```rust
pub struct EntropyScore {
    pub token_entropy: f64,
    pub pattern_repetition: f64,
    pub branch_similarity: f64,
    pub effective_complexity: f64,
    pub unique_variables: usize,     // New: variable diversity
    pub max_nesting: u32,            // New: maximum nesting depth
    pub dampening_applied: f64,      // New: actual dampening factor
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Dampening Examples**:
   - Simple pattern (5 cyclomatic): 5 × 0.85 = 4.25
   - Complex pattern (15 cyclomatic): 15 × 0.75 = 11.25
   - Validation logic (20 cyclomatic): 20 × 0.80 = 16
   - Mixed patterns (10 cyclomatic): 10 × 0.70 = 7

2. **Why 30% Maximum**:
   - Preserves score differentiation
   - Prevents hiding real complexity
   - Still recognizes pattern simplicity
   - Balances false positives and negatives

3. **Configuration Guidelines**:
   - Increase reduction for codebases with many generated patterns
   - Decrease reduction for complex domain logic
   - Disable for security-critical code reviews

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
- Complexity scores will increase for pattern-based code
- Functions previously under-scored will surface
- Priority assignments may change

### Migration Path
1. Automatic adjustment with new dampening
2. Users can tune dampening via configuration
3. Option to disable for compatibility

### Compatibility
- Entropy calculation unchanged
- Score structure unchanged
- CLI interface unchanged

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Better Complexity Recognition**: Complex patterns properly scored
2. **Improved Differentiation**: Less score clustering
3. **Fewer False Negatives**: Won't miss complex validation
4. **Maintained Pattern Recognition**: Still identifies simple patterns
5. **Tunable System**: Users can adjust for their needs

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: More functions flagged as complex
   - **Mitigation**: Configuration allows tuning

2. **Risk**: Users expect aggressive dampening
   - **Mitigation**: Document rationale, make configurable

3. **Risk**: Performance impact from graduated calculation
   - **Mitigation**: Cache intermediate results
