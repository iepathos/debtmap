# Specification 64: Remove Security Detection Subsystem

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Debtmap currently includes a comprehensive security detection module with 7 detectors, data flow analysis, and taint tracking. While security issues are technically a form of technical debt, including security detection in debtmap has created scope creep and maintenance burden that detracts from the tool's core purpose of identifying architectural and code quality debt.

Analysis reveals that debtmap's security module adds approximately 15 files and significant complexity for functionality that is better served by dedicated security tools like Semgrep, Bandit, cargo-audit, and other SAST/DAST solutions. These specialized tools have larger rule databases, security-focused expertise, and are actively maintained by security professionals.

## Objective

Remove security detection capabilities from debtmap to refocus the tool on its core competency of technical debt analysis, reduce maintenance burden, and eliminate duplication with specialized security tools.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Remove all security-specific detection modules from the codebase
- Remove security-related CLI options and configuration
- Remove security-specific debt types and scoring factors
- Preserve security-adjacent debt detection that relates to code quality:
  - Unsafe code blocks (as complexity indicators)
  - Error swallowing patterns (as reliability issues)
  - Input validation patterns (as code organization issues)
- Update documentation to reflect the removal
- Ensure no breaking changes to core debt detection functionality

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility for non-security CLI options
- Preserve performance characteristics of the analysis pipeline
- Keep the codebase maintainable and focused

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All files in `src/security/` directory removed
- [ ] Security-specific CLI flag `--security-enhanced` removed from CLI parser
- [ ] Security debt types removed from DebtType enum
- [ ] Security scoring factors removed from unified scoring system
- [ ] Data flow analysis module removed (unless used by other features)
- [ ] Security-related tests removed or updated
- [ ] Documentation updated to remove security detection references
- [ ] Project README updated to clarify tool focus
- [ ] All existing non-security tests continue to pass
- [ ] No regression in core debt detection capabilities
- [ ] Security-adjacent patterns (unsafe blocks, error handling) still detected as complexity/reliability issues

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. Remove security module and all its detectors
2. Remove security-specific data flow analysis
3. Update unified scoring to remove security factors
4. Clean up security-related CLI options
5. Update tests to remove security-specific assertions
6. Update documentation

### Architecture Changes
- Remove `src/security/` directory entirely
- Remove security detector invocations from main analysis pipeline
- Remove security-specific fields from unified scoring structures
- Simplify DebtType enum by removing security variants

### Files to Remove
```
src/security/
├── crypto_detector.rs
├── hardcoded_secret_detector.rs
├── input_validation_detector.rs
├── mod.rs
├── sql_injection_detector.rs
├── tool_integration.rs
├── types.rs
└── unsafe_detector.rs

src/data_flow/ (if not used elsewhere)
├── builder.rs
├── graph.rs
├── mod.rs
├── sinks.rs
├── sources.rs
├── taint.rs
└── validation.rs
```

### Code Modifications
- `src/cli.rs`: Remove `--security-enhanced` flag
- `src/main.rs`: Remove security analyzer invocations and scoring
- `src/core/mod.rs`: Remove security-specific DebtType variants
- `src/priority/unified_scorer.rs`: Remove security_factor from scoring
- `src/analyzers/rust.rs`: Remove security pattern analysis calls
- `src/analyzers/javascript/detectors/security.rs`: Remove file
- `src/analyzers/javascript/detectors/mod.rs`: Remove security detector imports

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**: 
  - Main analysis pipeline
  - CLI interface
  - Unified scoring system
  - JavaScript/TypeScript analyzers
  - Test suite
- **External Dependencies**: None removed

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Remove security-specific unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Update integration tests to remove security assertions
- **Performance Tests**: Verify performance improvement from reduced analysis
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure core debt detection unchanged

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Remove security-related comments
- **User Documentation**: Update CLI help text
- **Architecture Updates**: Update ARCHITECTURE.md to remove security detection
- **README Updates**: Clarify tool focus on technical debt, not security

## Implementation Notes

### Preserved Security-Adjacent Features
These features should remain as they detect code quality issues:
1. **Unsafe blocks detection**: Keep in complexity analyzer as indicator of code risk
2. **Error swallowing detection**: Keep in debt detector as reliability issue
3. **Missing validation patterns**: Keep as code organization issue, not security

### Migration Path for Users
Users currently relying on security detection should be directed to:
- **Rust**: cargo-audit, cargo-deny, clippy with security lints
- **Python**: bandit, safety, pylint security checks
- **JavaScript**: eslint-plugin-security, npm audit, snyk
- **General**: Semgrep, SonarQube, CodeQL

### Simplification Benefits
1. **Reduced scope**: Focus on core technical debt mission
2. **Lower maintenance**: No need to track evolving security patterns
3. **Clear boundaries**: Debtmap for debt, security tools for security
4. **Better accuracy**: Dedicated tools have better security detection
5. **Faster analysis**: Less code to analyze means better performance

## Migration and Compatibility

Breaking changes are acceptable during the prototype phase. Users should be informed that:
- The `--security-enhanced` flag will be removed
- Security-specific debt items will no longer appear in output
- Security scoring factors will not influence priority scores
- Users should adopt dedicated security tools for security analysis

## Success Metrics

- Code reduction of ~2000+ lines
- Test suite runtime improvement of 10-15%
- Clearer tool purpose and documentation
- Reduced false positives from security pattern misidentification
- Simplified maintenance and contribution guidelines
