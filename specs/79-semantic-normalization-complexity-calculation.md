# Specification 79: Semantic Normalization for Complexity Calculation

**Category**: enhancement
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [70] Python Entropy Analysis Support

## Context

The current complexity calculation system in debtmap produces false positives when code formatting changes occur. Specifically, when tools like `rustfmt` or `black` reformat code by wrapping long expressions across multiple lines, the AST-based complexity metrics incorrectly interpret these formatting changes as increased cognitive complexity.

This was demonstrated in commit c257094 where formatting-only changes led to an 8.5% increase in debt score despite no logical complexity changes. Industry standards (SonarQube, academic research) confirm that cognitive complexity should measure logical flow, not visual presentation.

The problem affects all language analyzers but is most pronounced in:
- Multi-line function signatures and tuple returns
- Formatted string literals and assertions  
- Complex pattern matching expressions
- Chain method calls with line breaks

## Objective

Implement semantic normalization that removes formatting artifacts from complexity calculations while preserving accurate detection of genuine logical complexity increases. The system should produce identical complexity scores for logically equivalent code regardless of formatting differences.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **AST Normalization**: Standardize AST structures to remove formatting variations before complexity calculation
- **Cross-Language Support**: Apply normalization consistently across Rust, Python, and JavaScript analyzers
- **Pattern Preservation**: Maintain existing pattern recognition capabilities from specification 70
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing complexity thresholds remain meaningful
- **Performance Maintenance**: Normalization overhead must not exceed 10% of current analysis time

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accuracy**: Eliminate 100% of formatting-induced false positives without reducing detection of real complexity
- **Determinism**: Identical complexity scores for semantically equivalent code across different formatting styles
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing entropy analysis and pattern adjustment systems
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between normalization logic and core complexity calculation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Formatting Immunity**: Rustfmt/black/prettier formatting changes produce zero complexity score differences
- [ ] **Multi-line Expression Handling**: Function signatures, tuple destructuring, and method chains normalized correctly
- [ ] **String Literal Normalization**: Multi-line strings and formatted assertions treated as single logical units
- [ ] **Pattern Matching Preservation**: Complex match expressions maintain accurate complexity scoring
- [ ] **Cross-Language Consistency**: Normalization behaves consistently across all supported languages
- [ ] **Performance Benchmark**: Analysis time increases by no more than 10% with normalization enabled
- [ ] **Regression Prevention**: All existing complexity test cases continue to pass with identical scores
- [ ] **Integration Validation**: Entropy analysis and pattern adjustments work correctly with normalized AST

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Core Normalization Infrastructure**
```rust
// New module: src/complexity/semantic_normalizer.rs
pub trait SemanticNormalizer {
    type Input;
    type Output;
    
    fn normalize(&self, input: Self::Input) -> Self::Output;
}

// Rust-specific normalizer
pub struct RustSemanticNormalizer;
impl SemanticNormalizer for RustSemanticNormalizer {
    type Input = syn::Block;
    type Output = NormalizedBlock;
    
    fn normalize(&self, block: syn::Block) -> NormalizedBlock {
        // Remove formatting artifacts while preserving logical structure
    }
}
```

**Phase 2: Language-Specific Normalization**
- **Rust**: Normalize `syn::Block` structures, collapse multi-line expressions, standardize tuple formatting
- **Python**: Normalize `rustpython_parser::ast::Stmt` trees, handle multi-line strings and expressions
- **JavaScript**: Normalize `tree-sitter` parse trees, standardize arrow functions and template literals

**Phase 3: Integration with Existing Systems**
- Update `src/complexity/cognitive.rs` to use normalized AST
- Integrate with `src/complexity/pattern_adjustments.rs` 
- Maintain compatibility with entropy analysis from specification 70

### Architecture Changes

**New Components:**
```
src/complexity/
├── semantic_normalizer.rs     # Core normalization trait and infrastructure
├── rust_normalizer.rs         # Rust-specific AST normalization
├── python_normalizer.rs       # Python AST normalization  
└── javascript_normalizer.rs   # JavaScript/TypeScript normalization
```

**Modified Components:**
- `src/complexity/cognitive.rs`: Accept normalized AST input

### Data Structures

**Core Normalization Types:**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct NormalizedBlock {
    pub statements: Vec<NormalizedStatement>,
    pub logical_structure: LogicalStructure,
    pub formatting_metadata: FormattingMetadata,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum NormalizedStatement {
    Expression(NormalizedExpression),
    Declaration(NormalizedDeclaration),
    Control(NormalizedControl),
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct FormattingMetadata {
    pub original_lines: usize,
    pub normalized_lines: usize,
    pub whitespace_changes: u32,
}
```

**Language-Specific Extensions:**
```rust
// Rust-specific normalized structures
pub struct RustNormalizedExpression {
    pub expr_type: RustExprType,
    pub logical_components: Vec<LogicalComponent>,
    pub original_syn_expr: syn::Expr, // For debugging
}

// Python-specific normalized structures  
pub struct PythonNormalizedStatement {
    pub stmt_type: PythonStmtType,
    pub logical_depth: usize,
    pub original_ast_node: python_parser::ast::Stmt,
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

**Public Normalization API:**
```rust
// Main entry point for complexity calculation
pub fn calculate_normalized_complexity(
    language: Language,
    source: &str
) -> Result<ComplexityResult, ComplexityError> {
    let normalizer = create_normalizer(language)?;
    let normalized = normalizer.normalize(parse_source(source)?)?;
    calculate_complexity_from_normalized(normalized)
}

// Direct normalization access for testing
pub fn normalize_for_language(
    language: Language,
    ast: LanguageAST
) -> Result<NormalizedAST, NormalizationError> {
    let normalizer = create_normalizer(language)?;
    normalizer.normalize(ast)
}
```

**Integration Interface:**
```rust
// Updated complexity calculation interface
impl ComplexityCalculator {
    pub fn calculate_with_normalization(
        &self,
        normalized_ast: &NormalizedAST
    ) -> ComplexityResult {
        // Use normalized AST for all complexity calculations
    }
    
    pub fn calculate_legacy(
        &self, 
        raw_ast: &RawAST
    ) -> ComplexityResult {
        // Maintain backward compatibility for migration period
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Normalization Transformations

**Common Formatting Artifacts to Remove:**
- Multi-line vs single-line expressions (treat as equivalent)
- Parentheses added for readability (preserve only semantically required)
- Whitespace and indentation variations (normalize to consistent style)
- Comment placement and formatting (preserve semantic comments only)

**Language-Specific Considerations:**
- **Rust**: Handle tuple destructuring, match expression formatting, trait bounds
- **Python**: Handle list comprehensions, lambda formatting, string continuation
- **JavaScript**: Handle arrow function formatting, template literal whitespace, object destructuring

### Performance Optimizations

**Caching Strategy:**
- Cache normalized AST structures for frequently analyzed files
- Implement content-based cache keys to detect when re-normalization is needed
- Use memory-mapped files for large AST structures

**Lazy Normalization:**
- Only normalize AST nodes that affect complexity calculation
- Skip normalization for nodes that don't contribute to complexity metrics
- Implement incremental normalization for large files

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation:**
- If normalization fails, fall back to original AST with warning
- Provide detailed error messages for debugging normalization issues
- Implement recovery strategies for partially corrupted AST structures

**Validation:**
- Verify normalized AST maintains semantic equivalence with original
- Detect and report normalization transformations that might affect correctness
- Provide diagnostic tools for investigating normalization behavior

## Migration and Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- Maintain existing complexity calculation API during transition period
- Provide feature flags to enable/disable normalization
- Support both normalized and legacy complexity calculation modes
- Ensure existing configuration files continue to work

### Migration Timeline
1. **Phase 1**: Implement normalization infrastructure with feature flag
2. **Phase 2**: Enable normalization by default, maintain legacy option
3. **Phase 3**: Remove legacy calculation mode after validation period
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize normalization performance based on usage patterns

### Breaking Changes
During prototype phase, breaking changes are allowed for optimal design:
- Complexity scores may change after normalization implementation
- Some edge cases in complexity calculation may be handled differently
- Configuration file format may be updated for normalization settings

### Validation Strategy
- Run normalization on large codebases to validate correctness
- Compare complexity scores before and after normalization for known formatting changes
- Collect user feedback on normalization accuracy and performance
- Monitor false positive rates to ensure normalization effectiveness
