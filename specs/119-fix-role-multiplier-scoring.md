# Specification 119: Fix Role Multiplier Clamping and Coverage Weights for Accurate Function Scoring

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Debtmap's role-based scoring system correctly identifies function roles (EntryPoint, IOWrapper, PureLogic, etc.) and assigns role multipliers to adjust priority scores. However, the current implementation has two critical issues causing I/O functions and entry points to be over-scored:

### **Issue 1: Role Multiplier Clamping Defeats Differentiation**

**Location**: `src/priority/unified_scorer.rs:277`

```rust
// Current implementation:
let role_multiplier: f64 = match role {
    FunctionRole::EntryPoint => 1.5,      // 50% increase intended
    FunctionRole::IOWrapper => 0.5,       // 50% reduction intended
    // ...
};

// BUT then immediately clamped:
let clamped_role_multiplier = role_multiplier.clamp(0.8, 1.2);  // ❌ Problem!
```

**Impact**:
- IOWrapper intended multiplier: 0.5 → clamped to 0.8 (only 20% reduction instead of 50%)
- EntryPoint intended multiplier: 1.5 → clamped to 1.2 (only 20% increase instead of 50%)
- Result: I/O functions score **67% higher** than intended

**Real Example**:
```
#4: write_quick_wins_section() - IOWrapper, cyclo=16
- Base score: 22.0
- Intended: 22.0 × 0.5 = 11.0 (should NOT be in top 10)
- Actual: 22.0 × 0.8 = 17.6 (appears in top 10 as #4)
```

### **Issue 2: Coverage Weight Not Role-Adjusted**

Coverage gaps contribute equally to scores regardless of function role, but different roles have different testing strategies:

- **IOWrapper functions**: Better tested via integration tests (high unit coverage gaps acceptable)
- **Entry points**: Tested via integration/E2E tests (lower unit coverage expected)
- **Pure logic**: Should have high unit test coverage (gaps are problematic)

**Current**: All roles use 40% coverage weight
**Problem**: I/O functions with 0% coverage get maximum coverage penalty (11.0 × 40% = 4.4) despite being integration-tested

**Real Example**:
```
#4: write_quick_wins_section() - 0% unit coverage
- Coverage contribution: 11.0 × 40% = 4.4 (high penalty)
- Reality: Function is formatting output, integration tested via markdown generation tests
- Should: Coverage contribution should be ~2.0 (20% weight for I/O)
```

### **Combined Effect**

These two issues compound:
1. High base score from coverage gap + complexity
2. Insufficient role multiplier reduction (0.8 instead of 0.5)
3. Result: I/O functions appear in top 10 recommendations despite being correctly classified

## Objective

Fix role-based scoring to accurately reflect function importance by:
1. Removing or widening the role multiplier clamp to respect intended differentiation
2. Implementing role-specific coverage weights aligned with testing best practices
3. Ensuring scores accurately reflect testability and criticality of different function roles

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Role Multiplier Clamp Adjustment** (Solution 1)
   - Widen the clamp range from [0.8, 1.2] to [0.3, 1.8] OR remove clamping entirely
   - Allow intended role differentiation to be applied
   - IOWrapper functions should receive ~50% score reduction
   - EntryPoint functions should receive ~50% score increase

2. **Role-Specific Coverage Weights** (Solution 3)
   - Define per-role coverage weight multipliers
   - IOWrapper: 0.5x coverage weight (20% instead of 40%)
   - EntryPoint: 0.6x coverage weight (24% instead of 40%)
   - Orchestrator: 0.7x coverage weight (28% instead of 40%)
   - PureLogic: 1.0x coverage weight (40% unchanged)
   - Unknown: 0.85x coverage weight (34%)

3. **Configuration Support**
   - Make clamp range configurable via `config.toml`
   - Make role coverage weights configurable
   - Provide sensible defaults based on testing best practices

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain existing score ordering for PureLogic functions (no weight change)
   - Provide migration path for existing configurations
   - Document score changes in release notes

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: No performance degradation from changes
2. **Testability**: All adjustments must be unit testable
3. **Clarity**: Scoring calculations remain transparent and debuggable
4. **Consistency**: Same scoring logic across all output formats

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Role multiplier clamp range widened to [0.3, 1.8] or removed
- [ ] IOWrapper functions with role_multiplier=0.5 receive actual 50% reduction (not clamped to 0.8)
- [ ] EntryPoint functions with role_multiplier=1.5 receive actual 50% increase (not clamped to 1.2)
- [ ] Role-specific coverage weights implemented:
  - IOWrapper: 0.5x (coverage contributes 20% to base score)
  - EntryPoint: 0.6x (coverage contributes 24%)
  - Orchestrator: 0.7x (coverage contributes 28%)
  - PureLogic: 1.0x (coverage contributes 40%, unchanged)
- [ ] Configuration options added:
  - `role_multiplier_clamp_min` (default: 0.3)
  - `role_multiplier_clamp_max` (default: 1.8)
  - `role_coverage_weights.io_wrapper` (default: 0.5)
  - `role_coverage_weights.entry_point` (default: 0.6)
  - etc.
- [ ] Test case: write_quick_wins_section() scores ~8-11 (drops out of top 10)
- [ ] Test case: handle_call_graph_diagnostics() scores ~9-12 (drops out of top 10)
- [ ] Test case: Pure logic functions maintain relative ordering
- [ ] Documentation updated with new scoring behavior
- [ ] Migration guide for users with custom configs

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Role Multiplier Clamp Fix**

1. **Add Configuration Options** (`src/config.rs`)
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct RoleMultiplierConfig {
       #[serde(default = "default_clamp_min")]
       pub clamp_min: f64,

       #[serde(default = "default_clamp_max")]
       pub clamp_max: f64,

       #[serde(default = "default_enable_clamping")]
       pub enable_clamping: bool,
   }

   fn default_clamp_min() -> f64 { 0.3 }
   fn default_clamp_max() -> f64 { 1.8 }
   fn default_enable_clamping() -> bool { true }
   ```

2. **Update Scoring Logic** (`src/priority/unified_scorer.rs:277`)
   ```rust
   // Current:
   let clamped_role_multiplier = role_multiplier.clamp(0.8, 1.2);

   // New:
   let role_config = crate::config::get_role_multiplier_config();
   let clamped_role_multiplier = if role_config.enable_clamping {
       role_multiplier.clamp(role_config.clamp_min, role_config.clamp_max)
   } else {
       role_multiplier
   };
   ```

**Phase 2: Role-Specific Coverage Weights**

1. **Add Configuration** (`src/config.rs`)
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct RoleCoverageWeightMultipliers {
       #[serde(default = "default_io_wrapper_cov")]
       pub io_wrapper: f64,

       #[serde(default = "default_entry_point_cov")]
       pub entry_point: f64,

       #[serde(default = "default_orchestrator_cov")]
       pub orchestrator: f64,

       #[serde(default = "default_pure_logic_cov")]
       pub pure_logic: f64,

       #[serde(default = "default_unknown_cov")]
       pub unknown: f64,
   }

   fn default_io_wrapper_cov() -> f64 { 0.5 }
   fn default_entry_point_cov() -> f64 { 0.6 }
   fn default_orchestrator_cov() -> f64 { 0.7 }
   fn default_pure_logic_cov() -> f64 { 1.0 }
   fn default_unknown_cov() -> f64 { 0.85 }
   ```

2. **Update Coverage Factor Calculation** (`src/priority/scoring/calculation.rs`)
   ```rust
   pub fn calculate_coverage_factor_with_role(
       coverage_pct: f64,
       role: FunctionRole,
   ) -> f64 {
       let base_factor = calculate_coverage_factor(coverage_pct);
       let role_weights = crate::config::get_role_coverage_weight_multipliers();

       let weight_multiplier = match role {
           FunctionRole::IOWrapper => role_weights.io_wrapper,
           FunctionRole::EntryPoint => role_weights.entry_point,
           FunctionRole::Orchestrator => role_weights.orchestrator,
           FunctionRole::PureLogic => role_weights.pure_logic,
           _ => role_weights.unknown,
       };

       base_factor * weight_multiplier
   }
   ```

3. **Apply in Unified Scorer** (`src/priority/unified_scorer.rs`)
   ```rust
   // Replace current coverage factor calculation
   let coverage_factor = if has_coverage_data {
       calculate_coverage_factor_with_role(coverage_pct, role)
   } else {
       0.0
   };
   ```

### Architecture Changes

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. **Role Multiplier Clamping**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_role_multiplier_clamp_widened() {
       let config = RoleMultiplierConfig {
           clamp_min: 0.3,
           clamp_max: 1.8,
           enable_clamping: true,
       };

       // IOWrapper: 0.5 should not be clamped
       assert_eq!(apply_clamp(0.5, &config), 0.5);

       // EntryPoint: 1.5 should not be clamped
       assert_eq!(apply_clamp(1.5, &config), 1.5);

       // Extreme values should be clamped
       assert_eq!(apply_clamp(0.1, &config), 0.3);
       assert_eq!(apply_clamp(2.0, &config), 1.8);
   }

   #[test]
   fn test_role_multiplier_no_clamp() {
       let config = RoleMultiplierConfig {
           enable_clamping: false,
           ..Default::default()
       };

       assert_eq!(apply_clamp(0.5, &config), 0.5);
       assert_eq!(apply_clamp(1.5, &config), 1.5);
   }
   ```

2. **Role-Specific Coverage Weights**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_io_wrapper_coverage_weight_reduced() {
       let coverage_pct = 0.0; // 100% gap
       let base_factor = calculate_coverage_factor(coverage_pct);
       let io_factor = calculate_coverage_factor_with_role(
           coverage_pct,
           FunctionRole::IOWrapper,
       );

       // IOWrapper should have 50% of normal coverage impact
       assert_eq!(io_factor, base_factor * 0.5);
   }

   #[test]
   fn test_pure_logic_coverage_weight_unchanged() {
       let coverage_pct = 0.0;
       let base_factor = calculate_coverage_factor(coverage_pct);
       let logic_factor = calculate_coverage_factor_with_role(
           coverage_pct,
           FunctionRole::PureLogic,
       );

       // PureLogic should have 100% of normal coverage impact
       assert_eq!(logic_factor, base_factor);
   }
   ```

3. **Combined Effect**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_io_wrapper_final_score_reduced() {
       // Mock IOWrapper function with high complexity, 0% coverage
       let func = create_mock_function(
           "write_output",
           FunctionRole::IOWrapper,
           16, // cyclomatic complexity
           0.0, // coverage
       );

       let score = calculate_unified_priority(&func, ...);

       // With old logic: score would be ~16-17
       // With new logic: score should be ~8-11
       assert!(score.final_score < 12.0);
   }
   ```

### Integration Tests

1. **Real Codebase Scoring**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_io_functions_deprioritized() {
       let analysis = analyze_codebase("src/io/writers/");

       // IO wrapper functions should not appear in top 10
       let top_10 = analysis.top_items(10);
       let io_count = top_10.iter()
           .filter(|item| item.function_role == FunctionRole::IOWrapper)
           .count();

       assert!(io_count <= 2, "At most 2 I/O functions in top 10");
   }

   #[test]
   fn test_pure_logic_prioritized() {
       let analysis = analyze_codebase("src/");

       // Pure logic with complexity should dominate top 10
       let top_10 = analysis.top_items(10);
       let pure_logic_count = top_10.iter()
           .filter(|item| {
               item.function_role == FunctionRole::PureLogic &&
               item.cyclomatic_complexity > 10
           })
           .count();

       assert!(pure_logic_count >= 5, "Pure logic dominates top 10");
   }
   ```

2. **Regression Tests**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_known_io_functions_score_correctly() {
       // Test specific known cases
       let cases = vec![
           ("src/io/writers/enhanced_markdown/health_writer.rs",
            "write_quick_wins_section",
            8.0..12.0),  // Expected score range
           ("src/commands/analyze.rs",
            "handle_call_graph_diagnostics",
            9.0..13.0),
       ];

       for (file, func, expected_range) in cases {
           let item = find_debt_item(file, func);
           assert!(
               expected_range.contains(&item.unified_score.final_score),
               "{} scored {}, expected {:?}",
               func, item.unified_score.final_score, expected_range
           );
       }
   }
   ```

### Acceptance Tests

1. **Before/After Comparison**
   - Run analysis on debtmap's own codebase with old settings
   - Run analysis with new settings
   - Verify:
     - `write_quick_wins_section` drops from #4 to outside top 10
     - `handle_call_graph_diagnostics` drops from #3 to outside top 10
     - Pure logic functions rise in rankings

2. **Configuration Validation**
   - Test with custom clamp ranges
   - Test with custom coverage weights
   - Test with clamping disabled
   - Verify scores change as expected

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation

1. **Inline Comments**
   - Document why clamp range was widened
   - Explain role-specific coverage weight rationale
   - Link to spec 119 in comments

2. **Function Documentation**
   ```rust
   /// Apply role-specific coverage weight to coverage factor.
   ///
   /// Different function roles have different testing strategies:
   /// - IOWrapper: Integration tested, lower unit coverage expected
   /// - EntryPoint: E2E tested, lower unit coverage expected
   /// - PureLogic: Should be unit tested, full coverage expected
   ///
   /// # Arguments
   /// * `coverage_pct` - Percentage of lines covered (0.0-1.0)
   /// * `role` - Function role classification
   ///
   /// # Returns
   /// Coverage factor adjusted for role (0.0-11.0)
   pub fn calculate_coverage_factor_with_role(
       coverage_pct: f64,
       role: FunctionRole,
   ) -> f64
   ```

### User Documentation

1. **Configuration Guide** (`book/src/configuration.md`)
   ```markdown
   ## Role-Based Scoring Adjustments

   ### Role Multiplier Clamping

   By default, role multipliers are clamped to [0.3, 1.8] to prevent extreme
   score distortion while preserving role differentiation:

   - IOWrapper: 0.5x multiplier (50% reduction)
   - EntryPoint: 1.5x multiplier (50% increase)

   Configure in `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [scoring.role_multiplier]
   clamp_min = 0.3
   clamp_max = 1.8
   enable_clamping = true  # Set false to disable clamping
   ```

   ### Role-Specific Coverage Weights

   Coverage gaps contribute differently based on function role and testing strategy:

   | Role | Weight | Rationale |
   |------|--------|-----------|
   | IOWrapper | 0.5x | Integration tested |
   | EntryPoint | 0.6x | E2E tested |
   | Orchestrator | 0.7x | Integration tested |
   | PureLogic | 1.0x | Should be unit tested |

   Configure in `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [scoring.role_coverage_weights]
   io_wrapper = 0.5
   entry_point = 0.6
   orchestrator = 0.7
   pure_logic = 1.0
   ```
   ```

2. **Scoring Strategy Guide** (`book/src/scoring-strategies.md`)
   - Add section: "Role-Based Adjustments"
   - Explain why I/O functions score lower
   - Provide examples of score changes

### Architecture Updates

Update `ARCHITECTURE.md`:
```markdown
## Scoring System

### Role-Based Adjustments

Two mechanisms adjust scores based on function role:

1. **Role Multiplier**: Final score adjustment reflecting importance
   - Configurable clamp range [0.3, 1.8] by default
   - Can be disabled for maximum differentiation

2. **Coverage Weight Multiplier**: Adjusts coverage expectations by role
   - IOWrapper: 0.5x (integration tested, low unit coverage acceptable)
   - PureLogic: 1.0x (should be unit tested, coverage gaps critical)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Phased Rollout

**Phase 1 (Quick Win)**:
1. Implement role multiplier clamp widening
2. Add configuration options
3. Test on debtmap codebase
4. Validate I/O functions deprioritized

**Phase 2 (Refinement)**:
1. Implement role-specific coverage weights
2. Add configuration options
3. Fine-tune default weights based on results
4. Comprehensive testing

**Phase 3 (Polish)**:
1. Update all documentation
2. Add examples and guides
3. Release notes explaining changes

### Configuration Migration

For users with existing custom configs:
1. New config options have sensible defaults
2. Existing configs continue to work
3. Migration guide in release notes:
   ```markdown
   ## v0.3.0 Changes

   ### Improved Role-Based Scoring

   Role multipliers are no longer artificially clamped to [0.8, 1.2].
   This may change your top recommendations:

   - I/O functions will score lower (as intended)
   - Entry points may score higher
   - Pure logic with high complexity prioritized

   To revert to old behavior (not recommended):
   ```toml
   [scoring.role_multiplier]
   clamp_min = 0.8
   clamp_max = 1.2
   ```
   ```

### Edge Cases

1. **Extremely Complex I/O Functions** (e.g., cyclo=50)
   - Even with 0.5x multiplier, may still appear in top 10
   - This is correct behavior - genuinely problematic

2. **Pure Logic with Low Complexity**
   - Coverage weight 1.0x may over-prioritize simple untested functions
   - Acceptable: simple functions should be easy to test

3. **Entry Points with High Complexity**
   - 1.5x multiplier may over-prioritize
   - Correct: complex entry points are integration challenges

### Performance Considerations

- Configuration loading: One-time cost at startup
- Coverage factor calculation: Minimal overhead (one additional multiplication)
- Role multiplier clamping: Conditional check, negligible cost

## Migration and Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility

**Configuration**:
- New fields have defaults matching improved behavior
- Existing configs without new fields use defaults
- No breaking changes to config structure

**Scores**:
- Score changes are intentional improvements, not breaking changes
- Relative ordering of similar functions preserved
- Users may see different top 10 (this is the fix)

### Breaking Changes

None. This is a bug fix and optimization that improves scoring accuracy.

### Deprecation Path

The old clamping behavior [0.8, 1.2] is deprecated but can be manually configured if needed for transition period.

## Success Metrics

1. **I/O Function Deprioritization**
   - `write_quick_wins_section` drops from #4 to outside top 10
   - `handle_call_graph_diagnostics` drops from #3 to outside top 10
   - <20% of top 10 are I/O wrappers (down from 30-40%)

2. **Pure Logic Prioritization**
   - Complex pure logic functions (cyclo>15) dominate top 10
   - >60% of top 10 are PureLogic or critical EntryPoints

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - Reduced false positive reports
   - Top recommendations feel more actionable
   - Clear alignment with testing best practices

4. **Configuration Adoption**
   - Documentation clearly explains role-based adjustments
   - Users understand why I/O functions score lower
   - Advanced users can customize for project needs

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Weight Learning**: Adjust weights based on project testing patterns
2. **Test Type Detection**: Differentiate unit vs integration coverage in LCOV data
3. **Role-Specific Complexity Adjustment**: Further reduce I/O complexity impact
4. **Recommendation Filtering**: Option to exclude I/O wrappers entirely
