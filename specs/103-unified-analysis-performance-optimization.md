# Specification 103: Unified Analysis Performance Optimization

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: critical
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [102 - Incremental Unified Analysis Caching]

## Context

The unified analysis phase is a critical performance bottleneck in debtmap, particularly for medium to large projects (250+ files). Current profiling shows the analysis taking excessive time, with users experiencing timeouts when analyzing projects with 5000+ functions. The analysis runs entirely sequentially through 9 distinct steps, missing significant parallelization opportunities.

Performance measurements show:
- Small projects (39 functions): ~89ms total
- Medium projects (250 files, ~5000 functions): Multiple seconds, often timing out
- Key bottlenecks: Test function detection (150ms+), Per-function analysis (several seconds), File-level analysis with I/O

## Objective

Optimize the unified analysis performance to achieve sub-second analysis times for medium projects (250 files) and under 5 seconds for large projects (1000+ files) by implementing parallel processing, optimizing algorithms, and reducing redundant computations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Parallel Phase Execution**
   - Execute independent analysis steps concurrently
   - Maintain correct data dependencies between phases
   - Preserve analysis accuracy and results

2. **Per-Function Parallelization**
   - Process functions in parallel batches
   - Configure batch size based on available CPU cores
   - Maintain thread-safe data structures

3. **Optimized Test Detection**
   - Improve test function detection algorithm from O(n²) traversal
   - Cache test detection results within analysis run
   - Reduce redundant graph traversals

4. **File I/O Optimization**
   - Batch file reads for god object detection
   - Implement concurrent file reading
   - Cache file contents during analysis

5. **Progress Reporting**
   - Maintain detailed timing logs for each phase
   - Report progress for long-running operations
   - Provide performance metrics in verbose mode

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance Targets**
   - Medium projects (250 files): < 1 second
   - Large projects (1000 files): < 5 seconds
   - Maintain linear or better scaling with project size

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Configurable parallelism level (--jobs flag)
   - Memory usage proportional to project size
   - Graceful degradation on resource-constrained systems

3. **Compatibility**
   - Preserve exact analysis results
   - Maintain API compatibility
   - Support both parallel and sequential modes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unified analysis completes in < 1 second for 250-file projects
- [ ] Parallel execution reduces analysis time by at least 50%
- [ ] Test function detection optimized to < 50ms for large projects
- [ ] Per-function analysis supports configurable parallelism
- [ ] File I/O operations execute concurrently
- [ ] Progress reporting shows timing for each phase
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under parallel load
- [ ] Analysis results identical between sequential and parallel modes
- [ ] --jobs flag controls parallelism level
- [ ] Performance improvements verified by benchmarks

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Phase-Based Parallelization**
   ```rust
   // Phase 1: Parallel initialization (Steps 1-4)
   let (data_flow, purity, test_funcs, debt_agg) = rayon::join(
       || create_data_flow_graph(),
       || populate_purity_analysis(),
       || detect_test_functions(),
       || setup_debt_aggregator()
   );
   
   // Phase 2: Parallel function processing
   let items: Vec<UnifiedDebtItem> = metrics
       .par_iter()
       .filter_map(|metric| process_function(metric))
       .collect();
   
   // Phase 3: Sequential dependent steps
   analyze_files_for_debt();
   aggregate_by_file();
   sort_and_calculate_impact();
   ```

2. **Optimized Test Detection**
   ```rust
   // Current: O(n²) graph traversal
   // Optimized: Build reachability index once
   struct TestReachability {
       test_roots: HashSet<FunctionId>,
       reachable_from_test: HashSet<FunctionId>,
   }
   ```

3. **Concurrent File Analysis**
   ```rust
   use rayon::prelude::*;
   
   let file_results: Vec<FileMetrics> = files
       .par_iter()
       .map(|(path, functions)| analyze_file_concurrent(path, functions))
       .collect();
   ```

### Architecture Changes

1. **UnifiedAnalysisBuilder Pattern**
   - Separate construction phases for parallel execution
   - Builder accumulates results from parallel operations
   - Final build step assembles unified analysis

2. **Thread-Safe Data Structures**
   - Replace `Vector` with concurrent collections where needed
   - Use `Arc<RwLock>` for shared state
   - Implement lock-free algorithms where possible

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Add `ProgressReporter` trait for long operations
   - Implement progress bars for interactive mode
   - Detailed timing logs in verbose mode

### Data Structures

```rust
pub struct ParallelUnifiedAnalysisOptions {
    pub parallel: bool,
    pub jobs: Option<usize>,
    pub batch_size: usize,
    pub progress: bool,
}

pub struct AnalysisPhaseTimings {
    pub data_flow_creation: Duration,
    pub purity_analysis: Duration,
    pub test_detection: Duration,
    pub debt_aggregation: Duration,
    pub function_analysis: Duration,
    pub file_analysis: Duration,
    pub aggregation: Duration,
    pub sorting: Duration,
    pub total: Duration,
}

pub struct OptimizedTestDetector {
    call_graph: Arc<CallGraph>,
    test_roots: HashSet<FunctionId>,
    reachability_cache: HashMap<FunctionId, bool>,
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

```rust
pub trait ParallelAnalyzer {
    fn analyze_parallel(
        &self,
        options: ParallelUnifiedAnalysisOptions
    ) -> Result<UnifiedAnalysis>;
}

pub trait ProgressReporter {
    fn start_phase(&self, name: &str, total: usize);
    fn update_progress(&self, current: usize);
    fn complete_phase(&self, elapsed: Duration);
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Incremental Rollout**

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add metrics collection for production monitoring
   - Track phase timings in telemetry

4. **Resource Management**
   - Default to CPU count - 1 for parallelism
   - Respect system load average
   - Implement backpressure for memory constraints
