# Specification 05: Complexity-Coverage Risk Analysis

**Category**: testing
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

While test coverage tools are ubiquitous and provide comprehensive coverage metrics, they typically treat all code equally - a 10-line getter function counts the same as a 100-line algorithm with nested conditionals. This misses a critical insight: **complex code needs more thorough testing than simple code**.

Debtmap's unique strength lies in its sophisticated complexity analysis, calculating both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity metrics that reveal which code is genuinely difficult to understand and maintain. By correlating this complexity data with test coverage, debtmap can provide insights that neither coverage tools nor static analyzers offer alone.

The real technical debt isn't just "untested code" - it's "untested complex code" that poses the highest risk. A simple untested getter is low risk; an untested function with cyclomatic complexity of 20 is a ticking time bomb. This specification focuses on identifying these high-risk areas by analyzing the correlation between code complexity and test coverage.

## Objective

Implement **optional** complexity-coverage correlation analysis that, when provided with LCOV coverage data, combines it with debtmap's existing complexity metrics (cyclomatic and cognitive) to identify high-risk code areas, prioritize testing efforts based on actual risk rather than raw coverage percentages, and provide actionable insights about where additional testing will have the greatest impact on reducing technical debt. When no coverage data is provided, debtmap continues to perform all its existing analysis including complexity metrics, code smells, and technical debt detection.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Optional LCOV Integration**: Coverage analysis is completely optional - debtmap functions normally without it
- **Coverage File Input**: Accept optional LCOV file path via CLI parameter `--coverage-file` or `--lcov`
- **Graceful Degradation**: When no LCOV provided, output complexity metrics and suggest functions that would benefit most from testing based on complexity alone
- **Complexity-Coverage Correlation**: When LCOV is provided, calculate risk scores by multiplying complexity metrics with coverage gaps
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Rank functions by their complexity-weighted coverage risk when coverage data available
- **High-Risk Function Detection**: Identify functions where high complexity meets low coverage (requires LCOV)
- **Test Priority Suggestions**: Even without coverage data, identify complex functions that should be tested first
- **Coverage Impact Analysis**: When LCOV provided, predict which functions would most reduce risk if tested
- **Complexity-Based Recommendations**: Without LCOV, recommend testing functions with highest cognitive complexity
- **Risk Heat Maps**: Generate visualizations when coverage data available
- **Test ROI Calculation**: Calculate return on investment when both complexity and coverage data exist
- **Standalone Complexity Analysis**: Full complexity analysis works without any coverage data

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Correlation analysis should add minimal overhead to existing complexity calculations
- **Insight Quality**: Provide actionable, prioritized recommendations rather than raw metrics
- **Risk Accuracy**: Risk scores should correlate with actual bug density and maintenance costs
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stream LCOV parsing to minimize memory overhead
- **Incremental Analysis**: Support analyzing coverage changes between commits to track risk trends
- **Language Agnostic**: Work with LCOV from any language while leveraging debtmap's language-specific complexity analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Debtmap runs normally without any LCOV file and provides full complexity analysis
- [ ] Accept optional LCOV file via `--coverage-file` or `--lcov` CLI parameter
- [ ] When no LCOV provided, identify top 5 complex functions that should be tested first
- [ ] When LCOV provided, calculate complexity-weighted risk scores for all functions
- [ ] Identify "danger zone" functions when coverage data available: complexity > 10 AND coverage < 50%
- [ ] Without LCOV, rank functions by cognitive complexity for testing priority
- [ ] With LCOV, rank functions by risk score (complexity * coverage_gap) not raw coverage
- [ ] Generate test effort estimates based on cognitive complexity regardless of coverage data
- [ ] Provide "test these 5 functions first" recommendations (with or without coverage data)
- [ ] Show complexity-coverage correlation coefficient when LCOV provided
- [ ] Support dynamic thresholds when coverage available: functions with complexity > 15 require 90% coverage
- [ ] Generate risk matrix visualization only when coverage data available
- [ ] Calculate potential risk reduction only when LCOV provided
- [ ] Identify well-tested complex functions when coverage data exists
- [ ] Support LCOV files from: cargo-tarpaulin, pytest-cov, jest, nyc, gcov
- [ ] Performance remains within 1.2x of baseline when LCOV provided
- [ ] All existing debtmap functionality works identically when no LCOV file provided
- [ ] Clear messaging when analysis is enhanced with coverage vs complexity-only mode

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

The complexity-coverage correlation system will enhance debtmap's existing complexity analysis with risk-based insights:

1. **LCOV Parser Module**: Minimal parser focusing on function-level coverage data
2. **Risk Analysis Engine**: Core module that correlates complexity metrics with coverage data
3. **Priority Algorithm**: Smart ranking based on risk reduction potential, not raw metrics
4. **Insight Generation**: Produce actionable recommendations, not just data dumps
5. **Visualization Layer**: Risk matrices and heat maps showing the complexity-coverage landscape

```rust
pub struct RiskAnalyzer {
    complexity_weight: f64,    // Default: 1.0
    coverage_weight: f64,      // Default: 1.0
    cognitive_weight: f64,     // Default: 1.5 (cognitive is harder to test)
}

impl RiskAnalyzer {
    pub fn analyze_function(
        &self,
        complexity: &ComplexityMetrics,
        coverage: f64,
    ) -> FunctionRisk;
    
    pub fn calculate_risk_score(
        &self,
        cyclomatic: u32,

        coverage: f64,
    ) -> f64;
    
    pub fn estimate_test_effort(
        &self,
        cognitive: u32,

```rust
pub fn calculate_risk_score(
    cyclomatic: u32,
    cognitive: u32,
    coverage: f64,
) -> f64 {
    // Weighted risk formula emphasizing cognitive complexity
    let coverage_gap = (100.0 - coverage) / 100.0;
    let complexity_factor = (cyclomatic as f64 + cognitive as f64 * 1.5) / 2.0;
    coverage_gap * complexity_factor
}

pub fn calculate_risk_reduction(
    current_risk: f64,
    complexity: u32,
    target_coverage: f64,
) -> f64 {
    // How much risk would be eliminated by achieving target coverage
    current_risk * (target_coverage / 100.0)
}

pub fn prioritize_by_roi(
    functions: Vec<FunctionRisk>,
) -> Vec<TestingRecommendation> {
    // Sort by risk_reduction / test_effort for maximum ROI
    functions.sort_by(|a, b| {
        let roi_a = a.risk_score / a.test_effort.cognitive_load as f64;
        let roi_b = b.risk_score / b.test_effort.cognitive_load as f64;
        roi_b.partial_cmp(&roi_a).unwrap()
    });
    functions.into_iter().take(5).map(to_recommendation).collect()
}

## Implementation Notes

### Core Insight: Complexity-Coverage Correlation

The key innovation is not measuring coverage (existing tools do that well) but **correlating coverage with complexity** to identify actual risk. This approach recognizes that:

1. **Not all uncovered code is equally risky** - An untested getter is low risk; an untested algorithm with 20 branches is critical
2. **Testing effort varies by complexity** - A function with cognitive complexity 30 requires more test cases than one with complexity 3
3. **Coverage targets should be dynamic** - Complex code needs higher coverage than simple code
4. **ROI matters** - Testing simple code may increase coverage percentage but not reduce actual risk

### LCOV Format (Minimal Parsing)

We only need to parse function-level coverage from LCOV:

```
SF:<absolute path to source file> # Source file path
FN:<line>,<function name>         # Function start line and name
FNDA:<count>,<function name>      # Function execution count (0 = untested)
end_of_record                      # End of source file record
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Example 1: Without coverage data (default behavior)
debtmap analyze .

# Output includes complexity-based testing recommendations:
# === FUNCTIONS THAT NEED TESTING (by complexity) ===
# 1. src/parser.rs::parse_expression()
#    - Cyclomatic Complexity: 25
#    - Cognitive Complexity: 38
#    - Estimated Test Effort: COMPLEX (5-8 test cases needed)
#    - Recommendation: High complexity function - prioritize for testing

# Example 2: With LCOV coverage data
cargo tarpaulin --out Lcov
debtmap analyze . --lcov lcov.info

# Enhanced output with coverage correlation:
# CRITICAL RISK: src/parser.rs::parse_expression()
#   - Cyclomatic Complexity: 25
#   - Cognitive Complexity: 38
#   - Coverage: 0%
#   - Risk Score: 47.5
#   - Estimated Test Effort: COMPLEX (5-8 test cases needed)
#   - Recommendation: This function has the highest risk/effort ratio.
#                    Testing it would reduce codebase risk by 12%.
```

### Risk Analysis Examples

**Example 1: High Complexity, No Coverage (CRITICAL)**
```
Function: parse_complex_expression
Cyclomatic: 20, Cognitive: 35, Coverage: 0%
Risk Score: (20 + 35*1.5)/2 * 1.0 = 36.25
Priority: CRITICAL - Test immediately
```

**Example 2: Low Complexity, No Coverage (LOW)**
```
Function: get_name
Cyclomatic: 1, Cognitive: 1, Coverage: 0%
Risk Score: (1 + 1*1.5)/2 * 1.0 = 1.25
Priority: LOW - Not worth testing individually
```

**Example 3: High Complexity, Good Coverage (WELL-TESTED)**
```
Function: validate_input
Cyclomatic: 15, Cognitive: 20, Coverage: 95%
Risk Score: (15 + 20*1.5)/2 * 0.05 = 1.125
Priority: WELL-TESTED - Good example for the team
```

### Dynamic Threshold Algorithm

Instead of fixed coverage targets, use complexity-based thresholds:

```
Required Coverage = min(100, 50 + complexity * 2)

Examples:
- Complexity 1: 52% coverage required
- Complexity 10: 70% coverage required
- Complexity 20: 90% coverage required
- Complexity 25+: 100% coverage required
```

### Visualization Concepts

**Risk Matrix (Terminal Output)**:
```
Coverage % →
100 │ ✓✓✓ │ ✓✓✓ │ ✓✓  │ ⚠   │
 75 │ ✓✓✓ │ ✓✓  │ ⚠   │ ⚠⚠  │
 50 │ ✓✓  │ ⚠   │ ⚠⚠  │ ⚠⚠⚠ │
 25 │ ⚠   │ ⚠⚠  │ ⚠⚠⚠ │ 🔥🔥 │
  0 │ ✓   │ ⚠⚠  │ 🔥  │ 🔥🔥🔥│
    └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
      1-5   5-10  10-20  20+
           Complexity →

✓ = Low Risk  ⚠ = Medium Risk  🔥 = Critical Risk
```

**Actionable Output Format**:
```
=== TOP 5 FUNCTIONS TO TEST FOR MAXIMUM RISK REDUCTION ===

1. process_data() - Would reduce risk by 18%
   Current Risk: 42.5 (CRITICAL)
   Complexity: Cyclomatic=18, Cognitive=28
   Coverage: 0%
   Test Effort: COMPLEX (6-8 test cases)
   Why: Highest risk score with manageable test effort

2. validate_input() - Would reduce risk by 12%
   Current Risk: 28.0 (HIGH)
   Complexity: Cyclomatic=12, Cognitive=16
   Coverage: 15%
   Test Effort: MODERATE (4-5 test cases)
   Why: Core validation logic with many branches

[...]
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Function-Only Parsing**: Skip line-level coverage data for faster processing
- **Lazy Correlation**: Only calculate risk for functions with complexity > threshold
- **Cached Complexity**: Reuse existing complexity calculations from debtmap
- **Smart Filtering**: Ignore simple functions (complexity < 3) from risk analysis

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is a purely additive, optional feature

### Configuration Changes
- New optional CLI parameter: `--lcov <path>` or `--coverage-file <path>`
- No configuration required when not using coverage analysis
- Coverage thresholds only apply when LCOV file is provided

### Integration Requirements
- **Optional**: Users may generate LCOV files if they want enhanced risk analysis
- When providing LCOV, it should be up-to-date with analyzed code
- File paths in LCOV should match or be resolvable to source paths

### Backward Compatibility
- **100% backward compatible** - debtmap works exactly as before when no LCOV provided
- All existing workflows continue unchanged
- Coverage analysis only activates when explicitly requested via CLI parameter
- Existing configuration files work without any modifications
- Default behavior remains complexity-only analysis

### Graceful Degradation
- Missing LCOV file: Continues with complexity-only analysis
- Malformed LCOV: Warning message, continues with complexity-only analysis  
- Path mismatch: Analyzes files that can be matched, warns about others
- Empty LCOV: Treats all functions as having 0% coverage
