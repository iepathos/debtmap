# Specification 05: Complexity-Coverage Risk Analysis

**Category**: testing
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

While test coverage tools are ubiquitous and provide comprehensive coverage metrics, they typically treat all code equally - a 10-line getter function counts the same as a 100-line algorithm with nested conditionals. This misses a critical insight: **complex code needs more thorough testing than simple code**.

Debtmap's unique strength lies in its sophisticated complexity analysis, calculating both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity metrics that reveal which code is genuinely difficult to understand and maintain. By correlating this complexity data with test coverage, debtmap can provide insights that neither coverage tools nor static analyzers offer alone.

The real technical debt isn't just "untested code" - it's "untested complex code" that poses the highest risk. A simple untested getter is low risk; an untested function with cyclomatic complexity of 20 is a ticking time bomb. This specification focuses on identifying these high-risk areas by analyzing the correlation between code complexity and test coverage.

## Objective

Implement complexity-coverage correlation analysis that combines debtmap's existing complexity metrics (cyclomatic and cognitive) with LCOV coverage data to identify high-risk code areas, prioritize testing efforts based on actual risk rather than raw coverage percentages, and provide actionable insights about where additional testing will have the greatest impact on reducing technical debt.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **LCOV Parser**: Parse LCOV coverage report format focusing on function and branch coverage for correlation with complexity metrics
- **Coverage File Input**: Accept LCOV file path via CLI parameter `--coverage-file` or `--lcov`
- **Complexity-Coverage Correlation**: Calculate risk scores by multiplying complexity metrics with coverage gaps
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Rank functions by their complexity-weighted coverage risk, not raw coverage percentages
- **High-Risk Function Detection**: Identify functions where high complexity meets low coverage (the "danger zone")
- **Test Effort Estimation**: Estimate testing difficulty based on cyclomatic and cognitive complexity of untested code
- **Coverage Impact Analysis**: Predict which functions would most reduce risk if tested
- **Complexity-Adjusted Thresholds**: Dynamic coverage requirements based on code complexity (complex code needs higher coverage)
- **Risk Heat Maps**: Generate visualizations showing complexity vs coverage correlations
- **Test ROI Calculation**: Calculate return on investment for testing specific functions based on complexity reduction
- **Complexity Trend Analysis**: Track how complexity-coverage correlation changes over time

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Correlation analysis should add minimal overhead to existing complexity calculations
- **Insight Quality**: Provide actionable, prioritized recommendations rather than raw metrics
- **Risk Accuracy**: Risk scores should correlate with actual bug density and maintenance costs
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stream LCOV parsing to minimize memory overhead
- **Incremental Analysis**: Support analyzing coverage changes between commits to track risk trends
- **Language Agnostic**: Work with LCOV from any language while leveraging debtmap's language-specific complexity analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successfully parse LCOV coverage reports focusing on function-level coverage
- [ ] Accept LCOV file via `--coverage-file` or `--lcov` CLI parameter
- [ ] Calculate complexity-weighted risk scores for all functions
- [ ] Identify "danger zone" functions: complexity > 10 AND coverage < 50%
- [ ] Rank functions by risk score (complexity * coverage_gap) not raw coverage
- [ ] Generate test effort estimates based on cognitive complexity of untested code
- [ ] Provide "test these 5 functions first" recommendations based on risk reduction potential
- [ ] Show complexity-coverage correlation coefficient for the entire codebase
- [ ] Support dynamic thresholds: functions with complexity > 15 require 90% coverage, > 10 require 80%, etc.
- [ ] Generate risk matrix visualization showing function distribution across complexity/coverage quadrants
- [ ] Calculate potential risk reduction for testing each uncovered function
- [ ] Identify functions where high complexity is well-tested (good examples)
- [ ] Detect anti-pattern: high coverage but only on simple code paths
- [ ] Support LCOV files from: cargo-tarpaulin, pytest-cov, jest, nyc, gcov
- [ ] Performance remains within 1.2x of baseline complexity analysis
- [ ] Provide clear ROI metrics: "Testing function X would reduce risk by Y%"
- [ ] All existing functionality remains unaffected when no LCOV file provided

### APIs and Interfaces

**Risk Analysis Interface**:
```rust
pub struct RiskAnalyzer {
    complexity_weight: f64,    // Default: 1.0
    coverage_weight: f64,      // Default: 1.0
    cognitive_weight: f64,     // Default: 1.5 (cognitive is harder to test)
}

impl RiskAnalyzer {
    pub fn analyze_function(
        &self,
        complexity: &ComplexityMetrics,
        coverage: f64,
    ) -> FunctionRisk;
    
    pub fn calculate_risk_score(
        &self,

```

**Risk Calculation Algorithms**:
```rust
pub fn calculate_risk_score(
    cyclomatic: u32,
    cognitive: u32,
    coverage: f64,
) -> f64 {
    // Weighted risk formula emphasizing cognitive complexity
    let coverage_gap = (100.0 - coverage) / 100.0;
    let complexity_factor = (cyclomatic as f64 + cognitive as f64 * 1.5) / 2.0;
    coverage_gap * complexity_factor
}

pub fn calculate_risk_reduction(
    current_risk: f64,
    complexity: u32,
    target_coverage: f64,
) -> f64 {
    // How much risk would be eliminated by achieving target coverage
    current_risk * (target_coverage / 100.0)
}

pub fn prioritize_by_roi(
    functions: Vec<FunctionRisk>,
) -> Vec<TestingRecommendation> {
    // Sort by risk_reduction / test_effort for maximum ROI
    functions.sort_by(|a, b| {
        let roi_a = a.risk_score / a.test_effort.cognitive_load as f64;
        let roi_b = b.risk_score / b.test_effort.cognitive_load as f64;
        roi_b.partial_cmp(&roi_a).unwrap()
    });
    functions.into_iter().take(5).map(to_recommendation).collect()
}

## Implementation Notes

### Core Insight: Complexity-Coverage Correlation

The key innovation is not measuring coverage (existing tools do that well) but **correlating coverage with complexity** to identify actual risk. This approach recognizes that:

1. **Not all uncovered code is equally risky** - An untested getter is low risk; an untested algorithm with 20 branches is critical
2. **Testing effort varies by complexity** - A function with cognitive complexity 30 requires more test cases than one with complexity 3
3. **Coverage targets should be dynamic** - Complex code needs higher coverage than simple code
4. **ROI matters** - Testing simple code may increase coverage percentage but not reduce actual risk

### LCOV Format (Minimal Parsing)

We only need to parse function-level coverage from LCOV:

```
SF:<absolute path to source file> # Source file path
FN:<line>,<function name>         # Function start line and name
FNDA:<count>,<function name>      # Function execution count (0 = untested)
end_of_record                      # End of source file record
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Generate LCOV and analyze risk
cargo tarpaulin --out Lcov
debtmap analyze . --lcov lcov.info

# Output will highlight high-risk functions:
# CRITICAL RISK: src/parser.rs::parse_expression()
#   - Cyclomatic Complexity: 25
#   - Cognitive Complexity: 38
#   - Coverage: 0%
#   - Risk Score: 47.5
#   - Estimated Test Effort: COMPLEX (5-8 test cases needed)
#   - Recommendation: This function has the highest risk/effort ratio.
#                    Testing it would reduce codebase risk by 12%.
```

### Risk Analysis Examples

**Example 1: High Complexity, No Coverage (CRITICAL)**
```
Function: parse_complex_expression
Cyclomatic: 20, Cognitive: 35, Coverage: 0%
Risk Score: (20 + 35*1.5)/2 * 1.0 = 36.25
Priority: CRITICAL - Test immediately
```

**Example 2: Low Complexity, No Coverage (LOW)**
```
Function: get_name
Cyclomatic: 1, Cognitive: 1, Coverage: 0%
Risk Score: (1 + 1*1.5)/2 * 1.0 = 1.25
Priority: LOW - Not worth testing individually
```

**Example 3: High Complexity, Good Coverage (WELL-TESTED)**
```
Function: validate_input
Cyclomatic: 15, Cognitive: 20, Coverage: 95%
Risk Score: (15 + 20*1.5)/2 * 0.05 = 1.125
Priority: WELL-TESTED - Good example for the team
```

### Dynamic Threshold Algorithm

Instead of fixed coverage targets, use complexity-based thresholds:

```
Required Coverage = min(100, 50 + complexity * 2)

Examples:
- Complexity 1: 52% coverage required
- Complexity 10: 70% coverage required
- Complexity 20: 90% coverage required
- Complexity 25+: 100% coverage required
```

### Visualization Concepts

**Risk Matrix (Terminal Output)**:
```
Coverage % →
100 │ ✓✓✓ │ ✓✓✓ │ ✓✓  │ ⚠   │
 75 │ ✓✓✓ │ ✓✓  │ ⚠   │ ⚠⚠  │
 50 │ ✓✓  │ ⚠   │ ⚠⚠  │ ⚠⚠⚠ │
 25 │ ⚠   │ ⚠⚠  │ ⚠⚠⚠ │ 🔥🔥 │
  0 │ ✓   │ ⚠⚠  │ 🔥  │ 🔥🔥🔥│
    └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
      1-5   5-10  10-20  20+
           Complexity →

✓ = Low Risk  ⚠ = Medium Risk  🔥 = Critical Risk
```

**Actionable Output Format**:
```
=== TOP 5 FUNCTIONS TO TEST FOR MAXIMUM RISK REDUCTION ===

1. process_data() - Would reduce risk by 18%
   Current Risk: 42.5 (CRITICAL)
   Complexity: Cyclomatic=18, Cognitive=28
   Coverage: 0%
   Test Effort: COMPLEX (6-8 test cases)
   Why: Highest risk score with manageable test effort

2. validate_input() - Would reduce risk by 12%
   Current Risk: 28.0 (HIGH)
   Complexity: Cyclomatic=12, Cognitive=16
   Coverage: 15%
   Test Effort: MODERATE (4-5 test cases)
   Why: Core validation logic with many branches

[...]
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Function-Only Parsing**: Skip line-level coverage data for faster processing
- **Lazy Correlation**: Only calculate risk for functions with complexity > threshold
- **Cached Complexity**: Reuse existing complexity calculations from debtmap
- **Smart Filtering**: Ignore simple functions (complexity < 3) from risk analysis

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
- None expected (additive feature)

### Configuration Changes
- New CLI option: `--lcov <path>` or `--coverage-file <path>`
- New threshold options: `--coverage-threshold`, `--function-threshold`, `--line-threshold`

### Integration Requirements
- Users must generate LCOV files using their test framework
- LCOV file must be up-to-date with analyzed code
- File paths in LCOV must match or be resolvable to source paths

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Coverage analysis is optional and disabled by default
- Existing configuration files continue to work without modification
