# Specification 05: Test Coverage Debt Metrics

**Category**: testing
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Technical debt analysis is incomplete without considering test coverage as a critical quality metric. Untested or poorly tested code represents significant technical debt that can lead to bugs, maintenance difficulties, and reduced confidence during refactoring. Currently, debtmap identifies code smells, complexity issues, and TODO comments, but lacks integration with test coverage data to provide a holistic view of code quality and debt.

Modern development practices emphasize test-driven development and comprehensive test coverage. However, coverage metrics alone don't tell the full story - the quality of tests, coverage of complex code paths, and correlation between complexity and test coverage are equally important for debt assessment.

This specification aims to integrate test coverage analysis into debtmap's technical debt detection by accepting LCOV coverage reports - a universal format supported across all major languages and testing frameworks. Users will generate LCOV reports using their existing test tooling and provide them to debtmap for analysis, enabling language-agnostic coverage debt detection.

## Objective

Implement LCOV coverage report integration that enables debtmap to parse user-provided LCOV files and combine coverage data with existing complexity and debt analysis to identify high-risk, under-tested code areas and provide prioritized recommendations for improving test coverage where it matters most.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **LCOV Parser**: Parse LCOV coverage report format with full support for line, function, and branch coverage data
- **Coverage File Input**: Accept LCOV file path via CLI parameter `--coverage-file` or `--lcov`
- **Coverage Data Integration**: Map LCOV coverage data to analyzed source files using file paths
- **Coverage Debt Detection**: Identify untested and under-tested code segments as debt items
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Weight coverage debt by complexity and existing technical debt
- **Function-Level Coverage**: Extract and report function coverage percentages from LCOV data
- **Line Coverage Analysis**: Track covered vs uncovered lines with hit counts
- **Branch Coverage Analysis**: Parse and report branch coverage data (when available in LCOV)
- **Coverage Thresholds**: Configurable coverage thresholds with debt severity mapping
- **Multi-Language Support**: Handle LCOV files from any language (Rust, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- **Missing Coverage Handling**: Gracefully handle files in analysis that aren't in coverage report

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Parse LCOV files efficiently without significant slowdown
- **Scalability**: Handle LCOV files for large codebases (100k+ lines, multi-MB files)
- **Format Compliance**: Full support for LCOV format specification including all record types
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stream LCOV parsing to minimize memory overhead
- **Error Tolerance**: Continue analysis even if LCOV file is partially corrupted or incomplete
- **Extensibility**: Architecture allows future addition of other coverage formats (Cobertura, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Accept LCOV file via `--coverage-file` or `--lcov` CLI parameter
- [ ] Parse all LCOV record types: TN, SF, FN, FNDA, FNF, FNH, DA, LF, LH, BRDA, BRF, BRH
- [ ] Map LCOV source file paths to analyzed files correctly
- [ ] Identify functions with 0% coverage as high-priority debt items
- [ ] Identify functions with <50% coverage as medium-priority debt items

- [ ] Generate coverage debt reports in JSON, Markdown, and terminal formats
- [ ] Support configurable coverage thresholds via CLI or config file
- [ ] Track function-level coverage percentages from FN/FNDA records
- [ ] Handle missing files gracefully (files in analysis but not in LCOV)
- [ ] Provide coverage improvement recommendations prioritized by complexity
- [ ] Integrate coverage debt into existing suppression comment system
- [ ] Support LCOV files generated from: cargo-tarpaulin, pytest-cov, jest, nyc, gcov
- [ ] Performance remains within 1.5x of baseline analysis speed
- [ ] Memory usage increases by less than 25% when processing LCOV data
- [ ] All existing functionality remains unaffected when no LCOV file provided

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

The LCOV coverage integration will extend the existing debt detection system with coverage-specific analysis:

1. **LCOV Parser Module**: Dedicated parser for LCOV format specification
2. **Coverage Integration**: Merge parsed LCOV data with existing file analysis
3. **Risk Calculation**: Combine coverage percentages with complexity metrics
4. **Debt Classification**: Extend existing debt types with coverage-specific items
5. **CLI Integration**: Add coverage file parameter to existing analyze command

### Data Structures

**LCOV Data Models**:
```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct LcovReport {
    pub test_name: Option<String>, // TN record
    pub source_files: HashMap<PathBuf, SourceFileCoverage>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct SourceFileCoverage {
    pub path: PathBuf, // SF record
    pub functions: Vec<LcovFunction>, // FN/FNDA records
    pub lines: HashMap<usize, usize>, // DA records (line_num -> hit_count)
    pub branches: Vec<LcovBranch>, // BRDA records
    pub line_coverage: LineSummary, // LF/LH records
    pub function_coverage: FunctionSummary, // FNF/FNH records
    pub branch_coverage: Option<BranchSummary>, // BRF/BRH records
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct LcovFunction {
    pub name: String,
    pub start_line: usize,
    pub execution_count: usize, // 0 means uncovered
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct LcovBranch {
    pub line: usize,
    pub block: usize,
    pub branch: usize,
    pub taken: Option<usize>, // None = not executed, Some(n) = taken n times
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CoverageDebt {
    pub file: PathBuf,
    pub function_name: Option<String>,
    pub line_range: (usize, usize),
    pub coverage_percentage: f64,
    pub complexity_score: u32,
    pub risk_score: f64, // coverage_gap * complexity
    pub priority: Priority,
    pub recommendation: String,
}
```

**Extended Debt Types**:
```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Copy)]
pub enum DebtType {
    Todo,
    Fixme,
    CodeSmell,
    Duplication,
    Complexity,
    Dependency,
    Untested,        // 0% coverage
    Undertested,     // Below threshold coverage
    UncoveredBranch, // Uncovered conditional branches
    MissingTest,     // No corresponding test file
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

**LCOV Parser Interface**:
```rust
pub struct LcovParser;

impl LcovParser {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn parse_file(&self, path: &Path) -> Result<LcovReport>;
    pub fn parse_content(&self, content: &str) -> Result<LcovReport>;
}

// CLI Interface
pub struct CoverageOptions {
    pub lcov_file: Option<PathBuf>,
    pub coverage_threshold: f64, // Default: 80.0
    pub function_threshold: f64, // Default: 70.0
    pub line_threshold: f64,     // Default: 80.0
}
```

**Risk Calculation**:
```rust
pub fn calculate_coverage_risk(
    coverage_percentage: f64,
    complexity: u32,
) -> f64 {
    // Risk = (100 - coverage%) * complexity / 100
    let coverage_gap = (100.0 - coverage_percentage).max(0.0);
    (coverage_gap * complexity as f64) / 100.0
}

pub fn classify_coverage_priority(
    coverage_percentage: f64,
    complexity: u32,
) -> Priority;
```

**Integration Functions**:
```rust
pub fn integrate_lcov_with_analysis(
    file_metrics: FileMetrics,
    lcov_data: &SourceFileCoverage,
) -> FileMetrics;

pub fn generate_coverage_debt_items(
    lcov_coverage: &SourceFileCoverage,
    complexity: &ComplexityMetrics,
    thresholds: &CoverageOptions,
) -> Vec<DebtItem>;
```

## Implementation Notes

### LCOV Format Specification

LCOV is a simple text-based format with the following record types:

```
TN:<test name>                    # Optional test name
SF:<absolute path to source file> # Source file path
FN:<line>,<function name>         # Function start line and name
FNDA:<count>,<function name>      # Function execution count
FNF:<number>                       # Functions found
FNH:<number>                       # Functions hit
DA:<line>,<count>[,<checksum>]    # Line execution count
LF:<number>                        # Lines found
LH:<number>                        # Lines hit
BRDA:<line>,<block>,<branch>,<count> # Branch coverage
BRF:<number>                       # Branches found
BRH:<number>                       # Branches hit
end_of_record                      # End of source file record
```

### Usage Examples by Language

```bash
# Rust with cargo-tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin --out Lcov --output-dir .
debtmap analyze . --lcov lcov.info

# Python with pytest-cov
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=lcov:coverage.lcov
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.lcov

# JavaScript with Jest
jest --coverage --coverageReporters=lcov
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage/lcov.info

# TypeScript with nyc
nyc --reporter=lcov npm test
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage/lcov.info

# Go with go test and gcov2lcov
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
gcov2lcov -infile=coverage.out -outfile=coverage.lcov
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.lcov
```

### LCOV Parser Implementation Considerations

- **Path Resolution**: Handle both relative and absolute paths in SF records
- **Streaming**: Process LCOV files line-by-line to handle large files efficiently
- **Error Tolerance**: Continue parsing even if some records are malformed
- **Path Matching**: Match LCOV source paths to analyzed files flexibly
- **Performance**: Use lazy parsing where possible, cache parsed data
- **Cross-Platform**: Support both Unix and Windows path separators

### Risk Calculation Algorithm

**Base Risk Score**:
```
risk = (100 - coverage_percentage) * complexity / 100
```

**Priority Classification**:
- **Critical**: 0% coverage + complexity > 10
- **High**: <25% coverage + complexity > 5
- **Medium**: <50% coverage OR complexity > 15
- **Low**: All other cases

### Integration Strategies

**File Path Matching**:
- Normalize paths between LCOV and source files
- Handle different working directory contexts
- Support both absolute and relative paths
- Case-insensitive matching on Windows

**Coverage Gap Detection**:
- Files analyzed but not in LCOV report = 0% coverage
- Functions in analyzed files but not in LCOV = untested
- Lines in functions but not covered = coverage gaps

### Performance Optimizations

- **Streaming Parser**: Process LCOV line-by-line without loading entire file
- **Selective Loading**: Only parse coverage for files being analyzed
- **Path Indexing**: Build efficient lookup structure for file coverage
- **Memory Efficiency**: Store only essential coverage data in memory

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
- None expected (additive feature)

### Configuration Changes
- New CLI option: `--lcov <path>` or `--coverage-file <path>`
- New threshold options: `--coverage-threshold`, `--function-threshold`, `--line-threshold`

### Integration Requirements
- Users must generate LCOV files using their test framework
- LCOV file must be up-to-date with analyzed code
- File paths in LCOV must match or be resolvable to source paths

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Coverage analysis is optional and disabled by default
- Existing configuration files continue to work without modification
