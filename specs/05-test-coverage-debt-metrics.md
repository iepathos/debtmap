# Specification 05: Test Coverage Debt Metrics

**Category**: testing
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Technical debt analysis is incomplete without considering test coverage as a critical quality metric. Untested or poorly tested code represents significant technical debt that can lead to bugs, maintenance difficulties, and reduced confidence during refactoring. Currently, debtmap identifies code smells, complexity issues, and TODO comments, but lacks integration with test coverage data to provide a holistic view of code quality and debt.

Modern development practices emphasize test-driven development and comprehensive test coverage. However, coverage metrics alone don't tell the full story - the quality of tests, coverage of complex code paths, and correlation between complexity and test coverage are equally important for debt assessment.

This specification aims to integrate test coverage analysis into debtmap's technical debt detection, providing developers with actionable insights about which untested or under-tested code areas pose the highest maintenance risks.

## Objective

Implement comprehensive test coverage debt metrics that integrate coverage data with existing complexity and debt analysis to identify high-risk, under-tested code areas and provide prioritized recommendations for improving test coverage where it matters most.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Coverage Data Integration**: Parse and integrate test coverage data from multiple formats (lcov, cobertura, jacoco, etc.)
- **Coverage Debt Detection**: Identify untested and under-tested code segments as debt items
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Weight coverage debt by complexity, code churn, and existing technical debt
- **Coverage Quality Analysis**: Analyze test quality indicators beyond simple line coverage
- **Function-Level Coverage**: Track and report coverage at the function/method level
- **Branch Coverage Analysis**: Identify untested conditional branches and decision points
- **Integration Coverage**: Detect inter-module dependencies that lack integration test coverage
- **Coverage Trends**: Support historical coverage tracking to identify degradation patterns
- **Test File Association**: Link source files to their corresponding test files
- **Coverage Thresholds**: Configurable coverage thresholds with debt severity mapping

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Process coverage data efficiently without significant slowdown
- **Scalability**: Handle coverage data for large codebases (100k+ lines)
- **Format Support**: Support industry-standard coverage report formats
- **Memory Efficiency**: Process coverage data with minimal memory overhead

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

The test coverage integration will extend the existing debt detection system with coverage-specific analysis:

1. **Coverage Parser Module**: Dedicated parsers for different coverage formats
2. **Coverage Integration**: Merge coverage data with existing file analysis
3. **Risk Calculation**: Combine coverage, complexity, and churn metrics
4. **Debt Classification**: Extend existing debt types with coverage-specific items

### Architecture Changes

**New Files**:
- `src/coverage/mod.rs` - Main coverage analysis module
- `src/coverage/parsers.rs` - Coverage format parsers (LCOV, Cobertura, etc.)
- `src/coverage/integration.rs` - Integration with existing analysis pipeline
- `src/coverage/risk.rs` - Risk calculation algorithms
- `src/coverage/metrics.rs` - Coverage-specific metrics and calculations

**Modified Files**:
- `src/core/mod.rs` - Add coverage-related data structures
- `src/debt/mod.rs` - Extend debt detection with coverage analysis
- `src/cli.rs` - Add coverage data input options
- `src/io/output.rs` - Extend output formats with coverage debt reporting

### Data Structures

**Coverage Data Models**:
```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CoverageReport {
    pub format: CoverageFormat,
    pub files: Vec<FileCoverage>,
    pub summary: CoverageSummary,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct FileCoverage {
    pub path: PathBuf,
    pub line_coverage: LineCoverage,
    pub branch_coverage: BranchCoverage,
    pub function_coverage: Vec<FunctionCoverage>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct FunctionCoverage {
    pub name: String,
    pub line: usize,
    pub lines_covered: usize,
    pub lines_total: usize,
    pub branches_covered: usize,
    pub branches_total: usize,
    pub coverage_percentage: f64,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CoverageDebt {
    pub function_name: String,
    pub coverage_percentage: f64,
    pub complexity_score: u32,
    pub risk_score: f64,
    pub priority: Priority,
    pub recommendation: String,
}
```

**Extended Debt Types**:
```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Copy)]
pub enum DebtType {
    Todo,
    Fixme,
    CodeSmell,
    Duplication,
    Complexity,
    Dependency,
    Untested,        // 0% coverage
    Undertested,     // Below threshold coverage
    UncoveredBranch, // Uncovered conditional branches
    MissingTest,     // No corresponding test file
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces

**Coverage Parser Interface**:
```rust
pub trait CoverageParser: Send + Sync {
    fn format(&self) -> CoverageFormat;
    fn parse(&self, content: &str) -> Result<CoverageReport>;
    fn can_parse(&self, content: &str) -> bool;
}

pub struct LcovParser;
pub struct CoberturaParser;
pub struct JaCoCoParser;
```

**Risk Calculation**:
```rust
pub fn calculate_coverage_risk(
    coverage: &FunctionCoverage,
    complexity: &FunctionMetrics,
    churn: Option<&ChurnMetrics>,
) -> f64;

pub fn prioritize_coverage_debt(
    coverage_debt: Vec<CoverageDebt>,
    strategy: PrioritizationStrategy,
) -> Vec<CoverageDebt>;
```

**Integration Functions**:
```rust
pub fn integrate_coverage_with_analysis(
    file_metrics: FileMetrics,
    coverage_data: &FileCoverage,
) -> FileMetrics;

pub fn generate_coverage_debt_items(
    coverage: &FileCoverage,
    complexity: &ComplexityMetrics,
    thresholds: &CoverageThresholds,
) -> Vec<DebtItem>;
```

## Implementation Notes

### Coverage Format Considerations

**LCOV Format**:
- Line-based text format commonly used by GNU tools
- Supports line coverage, branch coverage, and function coverage
- Generated by gcov, lcov, and many JavaScript testing tools

**Cobertura Format**:
- XML-based format popular in Java and .NET ecosystems
- Comprehensive branch and line coverage data
- Supports package/class hierarchies

**Format Detection**:
- Implement automatic format detection based on file content
- Support multiple formats in single analysis run
- Graceful handling of malformed or incomplete coverage data

### Risk Calculation Algorithm

**Base Risk Score**:
```
risk = (1 - coverage_percentage) * complexity_weight * churn_weight
```

**Weighting Factors**:
- **Complexity Weight**: Higher complexity increases risk exponentially
- **Churn Weight**: Recent changes to uncovered code increase risk
- **Dependency Weight**: Uncovered code with many dependents is riskier
- **Critical Path Weight**: Code in critical execution paths has higher risk

### Integration Strategies

**Coverage Debt Prioritization**:
1. **Critical Priority**: 0% coverage + high complexity + recent changes
2. **High Priority**: <20% coverage + medium complexity + dependencies
3. **Medium Priority**: <50% coverage + low complexity OR high coverage + high complexity
4. **Low Priority**: >80% coverage + low complexity + stable code

**Test File Detection**:
- Convention-based detection (test/, tests/, __tests__ directories)
- Naming pattern matching (*_test.*, *_spec.*, Test*.*)
- Configuration-based custom patterns
- Language-specific test file conventions

### Coverage Quality Metrics

Beyond simple line/branch coverage:
- **Assertion Density**: Number of assertions per test
- **Test Complexity**: Complexity of test code itself
- **Mock Usage**: Heavy mocking may indicate fragile tests
- **Test File Size**: Very large test files may indicate poor organization

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Load coverage data only when needed
- **Caching**: Cache parsed coverage data between analysis runs
- **Incremental Updates**: Process only changed files when coverage updates
- **Memory Streaming**: Stream large coverage files instead of loading entirely

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
- None expected (additive feature)

### Configuration Changes
- New CLI options for coverage data input paths
- Coverage threshold configuration options
- Coverage format specification options

### Integration Requirements
- Coverage data must be generated by external tools
- Supported testing frameworks documented per language
- Clear guidance on generating compatible coverage reports

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Coverage analysis is optional and disabled by default
- Existing configuration files continue to work without modification
