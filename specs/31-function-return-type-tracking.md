# Specification 31: Function Return Type Tracking for Enhanced Type Resolution

**Category**: foundation
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [29 - AST-Based Type Tracking, 30 - Enhanced Type Tracking for Field Access]

## Context

The current type tracking system (specs 29 and 30) successfully resolves types for:
- Variables with explicit type annotations
- Struct literals and constructor calls
- Field access chains (e.g., `self.a.b.c`)
- Self references in methods

However, a significant source of false positives remains: functions and methods whose return types cannot be inferred from the call site alone. Common patterns that lead to unresolved types include:

```rust
let parser = create_parser();  // What type is parser?
let config = Config::load();   // Returns Self or Result<Self>
let service = ServiceBuilder::new().build(); // Builder pattern
let analyzer = get_analyzer(Language::Rust); // Factory function
```

Analysis of the debtmap codebase shows that approximately 30-40% of remaining false positives in dead code detection stem from inability to resolve types returned by function calls. This is particularly problematic for:
- Factory functions that create instances
- Builder patterns with method chaining
- Static constructors (e.g., `Type::new()`, `Type::default()`)
- Functions that return trait objects or complex types
- Cross-module function calls

## Objective

Extend the type tracking system to maintain a registry of function signatures and their return types, enabling accurate type resolution for variables initialized from function calls. This will significantly reduce false positives in dead code detection and provide more accurate call graph analysis for the debtmap tool.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Function Signature Registry**
   - Parse and store function signatures including return types
   - Track both free functions and associated functions (methods)
   - Support generic functions with type parameters
   - Handle async functions and their Future return types
   - Store function visibility (pub, pub(crate), private)

2. **Return Type Resolution**
   - Resolve types for variables initialized from function calls
   - Support method chaining (builder patterns)
   - Handle Result<T, E> and Option<T> unwrapping patterns
   - Track return types through match expressions and if-let
   - Support closure return types where determinable

3. **Cross-Module Function Resolution**
   - Track functions across module boundaries
   - Resolve fully-qualified function paths
   - Handle re-exported functions
   - Support use statements and imports

4. **Integration with Existing Type System**
   - Seamlessly integrate with GlobalTypeRegistry
   - Work with existing TypeTracker
   - Maintain compatibility with field access resolution
   - Preserve existing type inference capabilities

5. **Builder Pattern Support**
   - Track method return types for chaining
   - Identify builder pattern implementations
   - Resolve final type from `.build()` methods
   - Handle consuming vs non-consuming methods

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Function signature extraction in single pass
   - O(1) lookup for function return types
   - Minimal memory overhead (< 10MB for 100k functions)
   - No significant impact on analysis time (< 10% overhead)

2. **Accuracy**
   - 95%+ accuracy in return type resolution
   - Zero false type assignments
   - Graceful handling of unresolvable types
   - Clear distinction between known and unknown types

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-documented resolution algorithms
   - Extensible for future enhancements
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Function Signature Collection

```rust
pub struct FunctionSignatureRegistry {
    /// Map from fully-qualified function name to signature
    functions: HashMap<String, FunctionSignature>,
    /// Map from type to its methods
    methods: HashMap<String, Vec<MethodSignature>>,
    /// Builder pattern detection
    builders: HashMap<String, BuilderInfo>,
}

pub struct FunctionSignature {
    pub name: String,
    pub return_type: ReturnType,
    pub generic_params: Vec<String>,
    pub is_async: bool,
    pub visibility: Visibility,
    pub module_path: Vec<String>,
}

pub struct ReturnType {
    pub type_name: String,
    pub is_result: bool,
    pub is_option: bool,
    pub generic_args: Vec<String>,
}
```

#### Phase 2: Signature Extraction

```rust
impl<'ast> Visit<'ast> for SignatureExtractor {
    fn visit_item_fn(&mut self, item_fn: &'ast ItemFn) {
        let signature = extract_function_signature(item_fn);
        self.registry.register_function(signature);
        syn::visit::visit_item_fn(self, item_fn);
    }
    
    fn visit_impl_item_fn(&mut self, impl_fn: &'ast ImplItemFn) {
        let signature = extract_method_signature(impl_fn, &self.current_type);
        self.registry.register_method(signature);
        syn::visit::visit_impl_item_fn(self, impl_fn);
    }
}
```

#### Phase 3: Return Type Resolution

```rust
impl TypeTracker {
    pub fn resolve_function_call(
        &self,
        func_path: &str,
        generic_args: &[String],
    ) -> Option<ResolvedType> {
        let signature = self.function_registry.get_function(func_path)?;
        let return_type = instantiate_return_type(
            &signature.return_type,
            &signature.generic_params,
            generic_args,
        );
        Some(return_type)
    }
    
    pub fn resolve_method_call(
        &self,
        receiver_type: &str,
        method_name: &str,
    ) -> Option<ResolvedType> {
        let method = self.function_registry.get_method(receiver_type, method_name)?;
        Some(method.return_type.clone())
    }
}
```

#### Phase 4: Builder Pattern Detection

```rust
pub struct BuilderInfo {
    pub builder_type: String,
    pub target_type: String,
    pub build_method: String,
    pub chain_methods: Vec<String>,
}

impl BuilderDetector {
    pub fn detect_builder_pattern(&mut self, impl_block: &ItemImpl) {
        // Detect methods that return Self
        // Identify terminal build() method
        // Track the pattern
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Supported Patterns

1. **Simple Function Calls**
   ```rust
   let parser = create_parser(); // Resolves to Parser type
   let config = load_config();   // Resolves to Config type
   ```

2. **Static Constructors**
   ```rust
   let map = HashMap::new();     // Resolves to HashMap<K, V>
   let result = Result::Ok(42);  // Resolves to Result<i32, E>
   ```

3. **Builder Patterns**
   ```rust
   let service = ServiceBuilder::new()
       .with_config(config)
       .with_timeout(30)
       .build();              // Resolves to Service
   ```

4. **Factory Functions**
   ```rust
   let analyzer = get_analyzer(Language::Rust); // Resolves to Box<dyn Analyzer>
   ```

5. **Method Chains**
   ```rust
   let result = string
       .trim()      // -> &str
       .to_string() // -> String
       .into_bytes(); // -> Vec<u8>
   ```

### Unsupported Patterns

1. **Dynamic Return Types**
   ```rust
   fn get_handler(kind: HandlerKind) -> Box<dyn Handler> {
       match kind { /* runtime decision */ }
   }
   ```

2. **Macro-Generated Functions**
   ```rust
   make_functions!(foo, bar, baz); // Cannot analyze
   ```

3. **External Crate Functions**
   ```rust
   let client = reqwest::Client::new(); // Without source
   ```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Load signatures on demand
   - Cache frequently accessed functions
   - Defer generic instantiation

2. **Incremental Updates**
   - Track changed files only
   - Update affected signatures
   - Preserve unchanged data

3. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Intern common type strings
   - Compress signature data
   - Use compact representations

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
- None expected - this is purely additive functionality

### Migration Path
1. Existing type tracking continues to work
2. Function return tracking activates automatically
3. Gradual improvement in accuracy
4. No code changes required

### Compatibility Considerations
- Must work with all Rust editions (2015, 2018, 2021)
- Support different coding styles
- Handle incomplete or invalid code gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Feature Flag
- Initially deploy behind `--enable-return-types` flag
- Monitor performance and accuracy
- Enable by default after validation
- Provide opt-out mechanism if needed

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy Improvements**
   - 30%+ reduction in false positives for dead code
   - 95%+ accuracy in function return type resolution
   - Zero regressions in existing type tracking

2. **Performance Targets**

   - Sub-millisecond function lookup time

3. **User Impact**
   - Fewer false positive reports
   - More accurate call graphs
   - Better code navigation support
   - Improved developer confidence

## Risk Assessment
