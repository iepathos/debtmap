> 🚧 **Early Prototype** - This project is under active development and APIs may change

A fast, language-agnostic code complexity and technical debt analyzer written in Rust. Debtmap identifies which code to refactor for maximum cognitive debt reduction and which code to test for maximum risk reduction, providing data-driven ROI calculations for both.

## Why Debtmap?

### 🎯 What Makes Debtmap Different

Unlike traditional static analysis tools that simply flag complex code, debtmap answers two critical questions:
1. **"What should I refactor to reduce cognitive burden?"** - Identifies overly complex code that slows down development
2. **"What should I test first to reduce the most risk?"** - Pinpoints untested complex code that threatens stability

**Unique Capabilities:**
- **Cognitive Complexity Analysis**: Goes beyond cyclomatic complexity to measure how hard code is to understand, identifying functions that need refactoring to reduce mental load
- **Coverage-Risk Correlation**: The only tool that combines complexity metrics with test coverage to identify genuinely risky code (high complexity + low coverage = critical risk)
- **ROI-Driven Prioritization**: Calculates actual return on investment for both refactoring and testing efforts, showing which changes will have the most impact
- **Actionable Refactoring Guidance**: Provides specific recommendations like "extract nested conditions" or "split this 80-line function" rather than just flagging issues
- **Quantified Impact**: Provides concrete metrics like "refactoring this will reduce complexity by 60%" or "testing this will reduce risk by 5%"
- **Language-Agnostic Coverage Integration**: Works with any tool that generates LCOV format (Jest, pytest, cargo-tarpaulin, etc.)

**Performance:**
- Written in Rust for 10-100x faster analysis than Java/Python-based competitors
- Parallel processing with Rayon for analyzing massive codebases in seconds
- Incremental analysis caches results for lightning-fast re-runs

## Features

- **Multi-language support** - Fully supports Rust, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript with Go support coming soon
- **Comprehensive metrics** - Analyzes cyclomatic and cognitive complexity, code duplication, and various code smells
- **Coverage-based risk analysis** - Uniquely correlates complexity with test coverage to identify truly risky code
- **ROI-driven testing recommendations** - Prioritizes testing efforts by calculating risk reduction per test case
- **Parallel processing** - Built with Rust and Rayon for blazing-fast analysis of large codebases
- **Multiple output formats** - JSON, TOML, and human-readable table formats
- **Configurable thresholds** - Customize complexity and duplication thresholds to match your standards
- **Incremental analysis** - Smart caching system for analyzing only changed files
- **Flexible suppression** - Inline comment-based suppression for specific code sections and configuration-based ignore patterns
- **Test-friendly** - Easily exclude test fixtures and example code from debt analysis

## Metrics Explained

### Cyclomatic Complexity
Measures the number of linearly independent paths through code. Higher values indicate more complex, harder-to-test code.

- **1-5**: Simple, easy to test
- **6-10**: Moderate complexity
- **11-20**: Complex, consider refactoring
- **20+**: Very complex, high risk

### Cognitive Complexity
Measures how difficult code is to understand. Unlike cyclomatic complexity, it considers nesting depth and control flow interruptions.

### Code Duplication
Identifies similar code blocks that could be refactored into shared functions.

### Technical Debt Patterns
- **Long methods/functions**: Functions exceeding recommended line counts
- **Deep nesting**: Code with excessive indentation levels
- **Large files**: Files that have grown too large to maintain easily
- **Circular dependencies**: Modules that depend on each other
- **High coupling**: Excessive dependencies between modules

### Risk Analysis (With Coverage Data)

When LCOV coverage data is provided via `--lcov`, debtmap performs sophisticated risk analysis:

#### Risk Scoring
Functions are scored based on complexity-coverage correlation:
- **Critical Risk (50+)**: High complexity + low/no coverage
- **High Risk (25-49)**: Medium-high complexity with poor coverage
- **Medium Risk (10-24)**: Moderate complexity or coverage gaps
- **Low Risk (5-9)**: Well-tested or simple functions

#### Testing Recommendations
- **ROI-based prioritization**: Functions ranked by risk reduction potential
- **Test effort estimation**: Complexity-based test case recommendations
- **Actionable insights**: Concrete steps to reduce overall codebase risk

#### Coverage Integration
Supports LCOV format from popular coverage tools:
- **Rust**: `cargo tarpaulin --out lcov`
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `jest --coverage --coverageReporters=lcov`
- **Python**: `pytest --cov --cov-report=lcov`
- **Go**: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocover-cobertura < coverage.out > coverage.lcov`

## Suppressing Technical Debt Detection

Debtmap provides two ways to exclude code from technical debt analysis:

### 1. Inline Suppression Comments

You can suppress debt detection for specific code sections using inline comments. This is useful for test fixtures, example code, or intentional technical debt.

#### Suppression Formats

```rust
// Rust example
// debtmap:ignore-start -- Optional reason
// TODO: This will be ignored
// FIXME: This too
// debtmap:ignore-end

// Suppress next line only
// debtmap:ignore-next-line
// TODO: Just this line is ignored

// Suppress current line
// TODO: Ignored // debtmap:ignore

// Type-specific suppression
// debtmap:ignore-start[todo] -- Only suppress TODOs
// TODO: Ignored
// FIXME: Not ignored
// debtmap:ignore-end
```

```python
# Python example
# debtmap:ignore-start
# TODO: Ignored in Python
# debtmap:ignore-end
```

```javascript
// JavaScript/TypeScript example
// debtmap:ignore-start -- Test fixture data
// TODO: Ignored in JS/TS
// HACK: This too
// debtmap:ignore-end

/* Block comments also work */
/* debtmap:ignore-start */
// TODO: Ignored
/* debtmap:ignore-end */
```

#### Suppression Types

- `debtmap:ignore` - Suppress all debt types on current line
- `debtmap:ignore-next-line` - Suppress all debt types on next line
- `debtmap:ignore-start` / `debtmap:ignore-end` - Suppress block of code
- `debtmap:ignore[todo]` - Suppress only TODO markers
- `debtmap:ignore[fixme]` - Suppress only FIXME markers
- `debtmap:ignore[hack]` - Suppress only HACK markers
- `debtmap:ignore[*]` - Suppress all types (wildcard)

### 2. Configuration File Ignores

Use the `.debtmap.toml` configuration file to ignore entire files or directories:

## Configuration

Create a `.debtmap.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
[thresholds]
complexity = 15
duplication = 25
max_file_lines = 500
max_function_lines = 50
max_nesting_depth = 4

[ignore]
# Paths to completely ignore during analysis
paths = ["target/", "node_modules/", "vendor/"]
# File patterns to ignore (glob patterns)
patterns = ["*.generated.rs", "*.pb.go", "*.min.js", "test/fixtures/**"]

[languages]
# Languages to analyze (rust, python, javascript, typescript)
enabled = ["rust", "python", "javascript"]
```

### Automated Technical Debt Reduction

We use [mmm (Memento Mori)](https://github.com/iepathos/mmm) for automated technical debt reduction through AI-driven workflows. This allows us to continuously improve code quality without manual intervention.

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Run automated debt reduction (5 iterations)
mmm cook workflows/debtmap.yml -wn 5
```

This command:
- Creates an isolated git worktree for safe experimentation
- Runs up to 5 iterations of automated improvements
- Each iteration identifies and fixes the highest-risk technical debt
- Validates all changes with tests and linting
- Commits improvements with detailed metrics

#### What Gets Fixed

The workflow automatically addresses:
- High complexity functions (cyclomatic complexity > 10)
- Untested complex code (low coverage on risky functions)
- Code duplication (repeated blocks > 50 lines)
- Deep nesting and long functions
- Code style inconsistencies

#### Documentation

For detailed information on our development process:
- [MMM Workflow Guide](docs/MMM_WORKFLOW.md) - Using mmm for automated debt reduction
- [Claude Workflow Guide](docs/CLAUDE_WORKFLOW.md) - Manual debt reduction with Claude Code

#### Example Session

```bash
$ mmm cook workflows/debtmap.yml -wn 3
ℹ️  Created worktree at: /Users/glen/.mmm/worktrees/debtmap/session-abc123
🔄 Starting iteration 1/3
✅ Fixed: Reduced complexity in parse_lcov_file from 80 to 45
🔄 Starting iteration 2/3
✅ Fixed: Eliminated 120 lines of duplication in test utilities
🔄 Starting iteration 3/3
✅ Fixed: Improved test coverage for risk module from 45% to 78%
ℹ️  Total debt score reduced by 35%
```

After the workflow completes, review and merge the improvements:

```bash
# Review changes
pushd ~/.mmm/worktrees/debtmap/session-*
  git log --oneline
popd

# If satisfied, merge to main
mmm worktree merge session-abc123
```
