> 🚧 **Early Prototype** - This project is under active development and APIs may change

A fast code complexity and technical debt analyzer written in Rust. Debtmap identifies which code to refactor for maximum cognitive debt reduction and which code to test for maximum risk reduction, providing data-driven prioritization for both.

📚 **[Read the full documentation](https://iepathos.github.io/debtmap/)** for detailed guides, examples, and API reference.

## Why Debtmap?

Unlike traditional static analysis tools that simply flag complex code, debtmap answers two critical questions:

1. **"What should I refactor to reduce cognitive burden?"** - Identifies overly complex code that slows down development
2. **"What should I test first to reduce the most risk?"** - Pinpoints untested complex code that threatens stability

**Unique Capabilities:**
- **Entropy-Based Complexity Analysis** - Uses information theory to distinguish genuinely complex code from pattern-based repetitive code, reducing false positives by up to 70%
- **Coverage-Risk Correlation** - The only tool that combines complexity metrics with test coverage to identify genuinely risky code
- **Actionable Recommendations** - Provides specific guidance with quantified impact metrics instead of generic warnings
- **Blazing Fast** - Written in Rust for 10-100x faster analysis than Java/Python-based competitors
- **Free & Open Source** - MIT licensed, no enterprise pricing required

## What Makes Debtmap Different

| Capability | Debtmap Approach |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Complexity Analysis** | Entropy-based analysis distinguishes genuine complexity from repetitive patterns |
| **Risk Prioritization** | Correlates complexity with test coverage to identify truly risky code |
| **Recommendations** | Quantified impact metrics ("Add 6 tests, -3.7 risk reduction") |
| **Speed** | Rust-based parallel processing for 10-100x faster analysis |
| **Coverage Integration** | Works with any LCOV-compatible coverage tool |
| **Cost** | Free, open source, MIT licensed |

**Key Differentiator**: Debtmap is the only tool that combines entropy-based complexity analysis with coverage-risk correlation to reduce false positives and prioritize testing efforts.

## Quick Start (3 Minutes)

### Install
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iepathos/debtmap/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Analyze
```bash
# Basic analysis
debtmap analyze .

# With test coverage (recommended)
cargo tarpaulin --out lcov --output-dir target/coverage
debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info

# Generate JSON report
debtmap analyze . --format json --output report.json
```

### Review Results
Debtmap shows you exactly what to fix first with actionable recommendations:

```
#1 SCORE: 8.9 [CRITICAL]
├─ TEST GAP: ./src/parser.rs:38 parse_complex_input()
├─ ACTION: Add 6 unit tests for full coverage
├─ IMPACT: -3.7 risk reduction
└─ WHY: Complex logic (cyclomatic=6) with 0% test coverage
```

## Advanced Features

### God Object Detection
Debtmap identifies classes and modules with too many responsibilities using purity-weighted scoring that rewards functional programming patterns.

### Automated Technical Debt Reduction

📖 **See the [Prodigy Integration Guide](https://iepathos.github.io/debtmap/prodigy-integration.html)** for detailed information on using Prodigy and Claude Code for automated debt reduction.

We use [prodigy](https://github.com/iepathos/prodigy) for automated technical debt reduction through AI-driven workflows:

```bash
# Run automated debt reduction (5 iterations)
prodigy run workflows/debtmap.yml -yn 5
```

This command creates an isolated git worktree, runs iterations of automated improvements, validates changes, and commits with detailed metrics.

### Dependency Licensing Note

Debtmap includes Python parsing functionality via `rustpython-parser`, which depends on `malachite` (LGPL-3.0 licensed) for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. This LGPL dependency is used only for Python AST parsing and does not affect the MIT licensing of debtmap itself. For use cases requiring strict MIT-only dependencies, Python support can be disabled or replaced with an alternative parser.
