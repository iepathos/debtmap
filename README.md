# debtmap

> ðŸš§ **Early Prototype** - This project is under active development and APIs may change

A fast, language-agnostic code complexity and technical debt analyzer written in Rust. Debtmap helps identify areas of technical debt in your codebase by analyzing complexity, duplication, and code quality patterns.

## Features

- **Multi-language support** - Currently supports Rust and Python with extensible architecture for more languages
- **Comprehensive metrics** - Analyzes cyclomatic and cognitive complexity, code duplication, and various code smells
- **Parallel processing** - Built with Rust and Rayon for blazing-fast analysis of large codebases
- **Multiple output formats** - JSON, TOML, and human-readable table formats
- **Configurable thresholds** - Customize complexity and duplication thresholds to match your standards
- **Incremental analysis** - Smart caching system for analyzing only changed files

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iepathos/debtmap.git
cd debtmap

# Build and install
cargo install --path .
```

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install debtmap
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze current directory
debtmap analyze .

# Analyze with custom thresholds
debtmap analyze ./src --threshold-complexity 15 --threshold-duplication 50

# Check only complexity metrics
debtmap complexity ./src --threshold 10

# Analyze technical debt patterns
debtmap debt ./src --min-priority medium

# Output as JSON
debtmap analyze ./src --format json --output report.json

# Analyze specific languages only
debtmap analyze . --languages rust,python
```

## Commands

### `analyze`
Full analysis including complexity, duplication, and technical debt patterns.

```bash
debtmap analyze <PATH> [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --format <FORMAT>                 Output format [default: table] [possible values: json, toml, table]
  --output <FILE>                   Output file (stdout if not specified)
  --threshold-complexity <N>        Complexity threshold [default: 10]
  --threshold-duplication <N>       Duplication threshold percentage [default: 30]
  --languages <LANGS>               Comma-separated list of languages to analyze
```

### `complexity`
Analyze only code complexity metrics.

```bash
debtmap complexity <PATH> [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --format <FORMAT>     Output format [default: table]
  --threshold <N>       Complexity threshold [default: 10]
```

### `debt`
Identify technical debt patterns and code smells.

```bash
debtmap debt <PATH> [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --format <FORMAT>         Output format [default: table]
  --min-priority <LEVEL>    Minimum priority level [default: low] [possible values: low, medium, high, critical]
```

## Metrics Explained

### Cyclomatic Complexity
Measures the number of linearly independent paths through code. Higher values indicate more complex, harder-to-test code.

- **1-5**: Simple, easy to test
- **6-10**: Moderate complexity
- **11-20**: Complex, consider refactoring
- **20+**: Very complex, high risk

### Cognitive Complexity
Measures how difficult code is to understand. Unlike cyclomatic complexity, it considers nesting depth and control flow interruptions.

### Code Duplication
Identifies similar code blocks that could be refactored into shared functions.

### Technical Debt Patterns
- **Long methods/functions**: Functions exceeding recommended line counts
- **Deep nesting**: Code with excessive indentation levels
- **Large files**: Files that have grown too large to maintain easily
- **Circular dependencies**: Modules that depend on each other
- **High coupling**: Excessive dependencies between modules

## Configuration

Create a `.debtmap.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
[thresholds]
complexity = 15
duplication = 25
max_file_lines = 500
max_function_lines = 50
max_nesting_depth = 4

[ignore]
paths = ["target/", "node_modules/", "vendor/"]
patterns = ["*.generated.rs", "*.pb.go"]

[languages]
enabled = ["rust", "python"]
```

## Output Examples

### Table Format (Default)
```
File                      | Complexity | Duplication | Issues
--------------------------|------------|-------------|--------
src/analyzers/rust.rs     | 15         | 12%         | 2
src/core/metrics.rs       | 8          | 5%          | 0
src/debt/patterns.rs      | 22         | 18%         | 3
```

### JSON Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-09T12:00:00Z",
  "summary": {
    "total_files": 25,
    "high_complexity_files": 3,
    "high_duplication_files": 2,
    "total_issues": 8
  },
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "src/analyzers/rust.rs",
      "complexity": {
        "cyclomatic": 15,
        "cognitive": 18
      },
      "duplication_percentage": 12,
      "issues": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Architecture

Debtmap is built with a functional, modular architecture:

- **`analyzers/`** - Language-specific AST parsers and analyzers
- **`complexity/`** - Complexity calculation algorithms
- **`debt/`** - Technical debt pattern detection
- **`core/`** - Core data structures and traits
- **`io/`** - File walking and output formatting
- **`transformers/`** - Data transformation pipelines

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! This is an early-stage project, so there's plenty of room for improvement.
