# Debtmap: Ideal Functionality Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the ideal functionality for debtmap, a next-generation technical debt analysis tool that uniquely combines complexity analysis, coverage correlation, and ROI-driven prioritization. The vision is to evolve debtmap from a powerful command-line tool into a comprehensive technical debt management platform that serves individual developers, teams, and enterprises while maintaining its core philosophy of actionable, ROI-driven insights.

## Core Philosophy & Principles

### Foundational Principles
1. **Actionable Over Informational**: Every metric must lead to a concrete action
2. **ROI-Driven**: Prioritize based on actual value delivered, not abstract scores
3. **Developer-First**: Optimize for developer experience and productivity
4. **Language-Agnostic**: Support all major languages with consistent quality
5. **Performance-Critical**: Analysis must be fast enough for pre-commit hooks
6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple by default, powerful when needed
7. **Evidence-Based**: All recommendations backed by data and research

### Key Differentiators
- **Coverage-Risk Correlation**: Unique ability to identify truly risky code
- **Semantic Understanding**: Knows the difference between entry points and utilities
- **Business Impact Quantification**: Translates technical metrics into business value
- **Incremental Adoption**: Works immediately, improves with configuration
- **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**: Balances complexity, coverage, dependencies, and context

## Architecture Vision

### Current Architecture Strengths
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Functional programming patterns (monadic operations, lazy evaluation)
- Parallel processing with Rayon
- Language-specific analyzers with shared interfaces
- Composable pipeline architecture

### Ideal Architecture Enhancements

#### 1. Plugin System
```rust
// Plugin trait for extensibility
trait DebtmapPlugin {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn version(&self) -> Version;
    fn analyze(&self, context: &AnalysisContext) -> Result<Vec<DebtItem>>;
    fn configure(&mut self, config: &Config) -> Result<()>;
}

// Plugin registry for dynamic loading
struct PluginRegistry {
    plugins: HashMap<String, Box<dyn DebtmapPlugin>>,
    hooks: EventBus<AnalysisEvent>,
}
```

#### 2. Streaming Architecture
- Process large codebases without loading everything into memory
- Incremental updates based on git diffs
- Real-time analysis during development
- WebSocket support for IDE integrations

#### 3. Distributed Analysis
- Split analysis across multiple cores/machines
- Cloud-native deployment options
- Kubernetes operator for enterprise scale
- Results aggregation and caching

#### 4. Machine Learning Pipeline
```rust
// ML-enhanced risk prediction
struct MLRiskPredictor {
    model: TensorFlowLite,
    feature_extractor: FeatureExtractor,
    feedback_loop: FeedbackCollector,
}

impl MLRiskPredictor {
    fn predict_bug_probability(&self, function: &FunctionMetrics) -> f64;
    fn predict_refactoring_effort(&self, complexity: &ComplexityMetrics) -> Duration;
    fn learn_from_outcomes(&mut self, outcomes: &RefactoringOutcomes);
