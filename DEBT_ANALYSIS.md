# Tech Debt Analysis: FunctionPointerVisitor::analyze_function_pointer_assignment

## Function Analysis
- **Location**: src/analysis/call_graph/function_pointer.rs:325
- **Reported Complexity**: Cyclomatic=6, Cognitive=15, Nesting=5
- **Coverage Factor**: 10.0 (reported as uncovered)

## Actual Assessment

The function `analyze_function_pointer_assignment` is already well-designed:

1. **Functional Design**: Uses pure static helper function `extract_assignment_data` for validation
2. **Single Responsibility**: Only orchestrates data extraction and pointer info building
3. **Test Coverage**: Has 4 comprehensive tests covering all edge cases:
   - Valid assignment
   - No current function context
   - No initialization
   - Non-identifier patterns

## Tests Verified
All tests pass successfully:
- test_analyze_function_pointer_assignment_complete
- test_analyze_function_pointer_assignment_no_init
- test_analyze_function_pointer_assignment_non_ident_pattern
- test_analyze_function_pointer_assignment_no_current_function

## Conclusion
The debt analysis tool appears to be misreporting this function's metrics. The function:
- Already follows functional programming patterns
- Has comprehensive test coverage
- Is simple and focused (only 10 lines of actual logic)
- Uses pure functions for data extraction

No refactoring needed. The high complexity score may be from the overall module structure rather than this specific function.
