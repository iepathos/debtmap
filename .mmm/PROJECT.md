# Debtmap Project Status

## Current State
Progress: 100% of spec 01, spec 02, and spec 03 implemented

## What Exists
- ✅ Standalone Rust binary with CLI interface
- ✅ Functional programming architecture with pure functions
- ✅ Language analyzers for Rust and Python with accurate line tracking
- ✅ Complexity metrics (cyclomatic and cognitive)
- ✅ Comprehensive technical debt detection:
  - TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX/BUG detection with priority levels
  - Code smell detection (long parameters, large modules, deep nesting)
  - Code duplication detection with SHA-256 hashing
- ✅ Dependency analysis and circular dependency detection
- ✅ Coupling metrics (afferent/efferent coupling, instability)
- ✅ Multiple output formats (JSON, Markdown, Terminal)
- ✅ Configurable thresholds and filters
- ✅ Parallel file processing with rayon
- ✅ Immutable data structures with im crate
- ✅ Lazy evaluation pipelines
- ✅ Monadic error handling patterns
- ✅ Incremental analysis with caching support
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 27+ integration tests
- ✅ Inline suppression comments for false positive control:
  - Block suppressions with debtmap:ignore-start/end
  - Line-specific suppressions with debtmap:ignore
  - Next-line suppressions with debtmap:ignore-next-line
  - Type-specific suppressions (e.g., [todo,fixme])
  - Wildcard suppression with [*]
  - Optional reason documentation with -- reason

## Architecture Overview
The project follows a functional core / imperative shell pattern:
- Core analysis logic implemented as pure functions
- IO operations isolated at boundaries
- Immutable data structures throughout
- Function composition for building complex analyzers
- Transformation pipelines for data processing

## Key Capabilities
1. **Complexity Analysis**: Measures cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
2. **Debt Detection**: Identifies TODOs, FIXMEs, and code smells
3. **Duplication Finding**: Detects copy-paste code using content hashing
4. **Multi-language**: Supports Rust and Python analysis
5. **Flexible Output**: JSON, Markdown, and Terminal formats
6. **Performance**: Parallel processing for large codebases
7. **Suppression Support**: Fine-grained control over false positives
