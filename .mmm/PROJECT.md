## What Exists
- ✅ Standalone Rust binary with CLI interface
- ✅ Functional programming architecture with pure functions
- ✅ Language analyzers for Rust and Python with accurate line tracking
- ✅ Complexity metrics (cyclomatic and cognitive)
- ✅ Comprehensive technical debt detection:
  - TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX/BUG detection with priority levels
  - Code smell detection (long parameters, large modules, deep nesting)
  - Code duplication detection with SHA-256 hashing
- ✅ Dependency analysis and circular dependency detection
- ✅ Coupling metrics (afferent/efferent coupling, instability)
- ✅ Multiple output formats (JSON, Markdown, Terminal)
- ✅ Configurable thresholds and filters
- ✅ Parallel file processing with rayon
- ✅ Immutable data structures with im crate
- ✅ Lazy evaluation pipelines
- ✅ Monadic error handling patterns
- ✅ Incremental analysis with caching support
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 27+ integration tests
- ✅ Inline suppression comments for false positive control:
  - Block suppressions with debtmap:ignore-start/end
  - Line-specific suppressions with debtmap:ignore
  - Next-line suppressions with debtmap:ignore-next-line
  - Type-specific suppressions (e.g., [todo,fixme])
  - Wildcard suppression with [*]
  - Optional reason documentation with -- reason
- ✅ Complexity-Coverage Risk Analysis (spec 05):
  - Optional LCOV coverage file integration via --lcov or --coverage-file
  - Risk scoring based on complexity-coverage correlation
  - Critical risk function identification
  - Test effort estimation based on cognitive complexity
  - ROI-based testing recommendations
  - Risk distribution visualization
  - Works without coverage data - provides complexity-based recommendations
- ✅ Enhanced Testing Prioritization (spec 08):
  - Multi-stage prioritization pipeline
  - Zero-coverage priority boost with entry point detection
  - Module criticality scoring based on file patterns and dependencies
  - Dynamic ROI calculation with cascade effects
  - Effort estimation based on complexity and module type
  - Smart recommendations with clear rationale
- ✅ Fixed Complexity Calculations (spec 09):
  - Cyclomatic complexity correctly counts all branches and control flow
  - If/else statements properly add complexity
  - Match expressions use n-1 formula for arms
  - Nested functions and closures are properly counted
  - Realistic average complexity values (3-8 range typical)
- ✅ Context-Aware Risk Analysis (spec 11):
  - Critical path identification from entry points
  - Dependency risk propagation through module graph
  - Git history integration for change frequency and bug density
  - Pluggable context provider architecture
  - Weighted risk calculation with context contributions
  - Optional via --context CLI flag
- ✅ Dependency-Aware ROI Calculation (spec 14):
  - Builds dependency graph from module relationships
  - Cascade impact based on actual dependent modules
  - Module type bonuses (EntryPoint: 2x, Core: 1.5x, Api: 1.2x)
  - Dependency factor increases ROI for highly-depended code
  - Exponential decay for cascade propagation (70% per level)
  - Diminishing returns model for realistic risk reduction
  - Enhanced ROI formula with meaningful variation (0.1 to 10.0 range)
- ✅ Intelligent Test Function Debt Handling (spec 18):
  - Test functions excluded from main debt score calculation
  - Test functions no longer penalized for lack of code coverage
  - Separate test-specific debt types (TestComplexity, TestTodo, TestDuplication)
  - Coverage factor set to 0.0 for test functions instead of 10.0 penalty
  - Test debt tracked and reported separately with specific recommendations
  - Prevents debt score inflation when adding tests to the codebase
- ✅ Unified Debt Prioritization with Semantic Analysis (spec 19):
  - Single priority score combining complexity, coverage, ROI, and semantics
  - Semantic function classification (PureLogic, Orchestrator, IOWrapper, EntryPoint)
  - Coverage propagation through call graph for delegation patterns
  - Role-based priority multipliers to reduce false positives
  - Clean, actionable output formats (--top N, --priorities-only, --detailed)
  - Focus on measurable impact over unreliable time estimates
  - Unified scoring algorithm with weighted factors (25/35/25/15%)

## Architecture Overview
The project follows a functional core / imperative shell pattern:
- Core analysis logic implemented as pure functions
- IO operations isolated at boundaries
- Immutable data structures throughout
- Function composition for building complex analyzers
- Transformation pipelines for data processing

## Key Capabilities
1. **Complexity Analysis**: Measures cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
2. **Debt Detection**: Identifies TODOs, FIXMEs, and code smells
3. **Duplication Finding**: Detects copy-paste code using content hashing
4. **Multi-language**: Supports Rust and Python analysis
5. **Flexible Output**: JSON, Markdown, and Terminal formats
6. **Performance**: Parallel processing for large codebases
7. **Suppression Support**: Fine-grained control over false positives
8. **Risk Analysis**: Correlates complexity with test coverage for risk-based testing priorities
9. **Context-Aware Risk**: Considers critical paths, dependencies, and historical data
10. **Smart ROI Prioritization**: Dependency-aware testing recommendations with cascade effects
11. **Unified Prioritization**: Single, semantic-aware score for all technical debt items
