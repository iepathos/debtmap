# Debtmap Project Status

## Current State
Progress: 100% of spec 01, spec 02, spec 03, spec 05, spec 07, and spec 08 implemented

## What Exists
- ✅ Standalone Rust binary with CLI interface
- ✅ Functional programming architecture with pure functions
- ✅ Language analyzers for Rust and Python with accurate line tracking
- ✅ Complexity metrics (cyclomatic and cognitive)
- ✅ Comprehensive technical debt detection:
  - TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX/BUG detection with priority levels
  - Code smell detection (long parameters, large modules, deep nesting)
  - Code duplication detection with SHA-256 hashing
- ✅ Dependency analysis and circular dependency detection
- ✅ Coupling metrics (afferent/efferent coupling, instability)
- ✅ Multiple output formats (JSON, Markdown, Terminal)
- ✅ Configurable thresholds and filters
- ✅ Parallel file processing with rayon
- ✅ Immutable data structures with im crate
- ✅ Lazy evaluation pipelines
- ✅ Monadic error handling patterns
- ✅ Incremental analysis with caching support
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 27+ integration tests
- ✅ Inline suppression comments for false positive control:
  - Block suppressions with debtmap:ignore-start/end
  - Line-specific suppressions with debtmap:ignore
  - Next-line suppressions with debtmap:ignore-next-line
  - Type-specific suppressions (e.g., [todo,fixme])
  - Wildcard suppression with [*]
  - Optional reason documentation with -- reason
- ✅ Complexity-Coverage Risk Analysis (spec 05):
  - Optional LCOV coverage file integration via --lcov or --coverage-file
  - Risk scoring based on complexity-coverage correlation
  - Critical risk function identification
  - Test effort estimation based on cognitive complexity
  - ROI-based testing recommendations
  - Risk distribution visualization
  - Works without coverage data - provides complexity-based recommendations
- ✅ Enhanced Testing Prioritization (spec 08):
  - Multi-stage prioritization pipeline
  - Zero-coverage priority boost with entry point detection
  - Module criticality scoring based on file patterns and dependencies
  - Dynamic ROI calculation with cascade effects
  - Effort estimation based on complexity and module type
  - Smart recommendations with clear rationale

## Architecture Overview
The project follows a functional core / imperative shell pattern:
- Core analysis logic implemented as pure functions
- IO operations isolated at boundaries
- Immutable data structures throughout
- Function composition for building complex analyzers
- Transformation pipelines for data processing

## Key Capabilities
1. **Complexity Analysis**: Measures cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
2. **Debt Detection**: Identifies TODOs, FIXMEs, and code smells
3. **Duplication Finding**: Detects copy-paste code using content hashing
4. **Multi-language**: Supports Rust and Python analysis
5. **Flexible Output**: JSON, Markdown, and Terminal formats
6. **Performance**: Parallel processing for large codebases
7. **Suppression Support**: Fine-grained control over false positives
8. **Risk Analysis**: Correlates complexity with test coverage for risk-based testing priorities

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Spec 09)
- Fix critical complexity calculation bugs:
  - Cyclomatic complexity not counting branches correctly
  - Cognitive complexity nesting miscalculations
  - Function counting issues (601 files = 601 functions bug)
  - Unrealistic average complexity (should be 3-8, not 1.5)

### Near-term Enhancements
- Spec 10: Add modern pattern detection (async/await, callbacks, functional)
- Spec 11: Implement context-aware risk assessment
- Spec 12: Improve ROI calculations
- Spec 13: Add risk categorization system

### Long-term Goals
- Add more language support via tree-sitter
- Implement incremental analysis caching
- Add historical trend tracking
- Create Language Server Protocol implementation
