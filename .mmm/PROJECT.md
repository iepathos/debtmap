# Debtmap Project Status

## Current State
Progress: 100% of spec 01 implemented

## What Exists
- ✅ Standalone Rust binary with CLI interface
- ✅ Functional programming architecture with pure functions
- ✅ Language analyzers for Rust and Python
- ✅ Complexity metrics (cyclomatic and cognitive)
- ✅ Technical debt detection (TODOs, FIXMEs, code smells)
- ✅ Code duplication detection using SHA-256 hashing
- ✅ Multiple output formats (JSON, Markdown, Terminal)
- ✅ Configurable thresholds and filters
- ✅ Parallel file processing with rayon
- ✅ Immutable data structures with im crate

## Architecture Overview
The project follows a functional core / imperative shell pattern:
- Core analysis logic implemented as pure functions
- IO operations isolated at boundaries
- Immutable data structures throughout
- Function composition for building complex analyzers
- Transformation pipelines for data processing

## Key Capabilities
1. **Complexity Analysis**: Measures cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
2. **Debt Detection**: Identifies TODOs, FIXMEs, and code smells
3. **Duplication Finding**: Detects copy-paste code using content hashing
4. **Multi-language**: Supports Rust and Python analysis
5. **Flexible Output**: JSON, Markdown, and Terminal formats
6. **Performance**: Parallel processing for large codebases
