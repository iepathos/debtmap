# Fix Top Priority Tech Debt

Use debtmap to analyze the repository and identify tech debt, then fix the highest priority item.

## Process

1. **Generate coverage** - Run `cargo tarpaulin` to create LCOV coverage data
2. **Initial analysis** - Run `debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info` to identify issues with risk scoring based on complexity-coverage correlation
3. **Prioritize** - Follow debtmap's prioritization strategy:
   - **FIRST**: Check "TOP 5 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS" section - prioritize by ROI score (highest first)
   - **SECOND**: If no high-ROI testing opportunities (ROI < 5), then address "COMPLEXITY HOTSPOTS"
   - **THIRD**: Consider "CRITICAL RISK FUNCTIONS" only if they appear in testing recommendations
4. **Plan fix** - Create implementation plan based on priority type:
   - **For testing**: Write comprehensive test cases to achieve target coverage
   - **For complexity**: Refactor using functional patterns to reduce cognitive load
5. **Implement** - Apply the appropriate fix:
   - **For testing priorities**: Write comprehensive test cases covering edge cases, error conditions, and main paths
   - **For complexity refactoring**: Use functional programming patterns for idiomatic Rust:
     - Prefer iterators over loops
     - Use pattern matching over if-else chains  
     - Favor immutability and ownership patterns
     - Use Result/Option for error handling
     - Prefer pure functions without side effects
6. **Test** - Run all tests to ensure nothing breaks
7. **Verify** - Run cargo clippy and cargo fmt
8. **Final analysis** - Run `debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info` again to measure debt score improvement with risk analysis
9. **Commit** - Create a clear commit message including the debt score change

## Important Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: When making ANY commits, do NOT include attribution text like "ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" in commit messages. Keep commits clean and focused on the actual changes.

## Steps

```bash
# Generate LCOV coverage data with cargo tarpaulin
echo "Generating coverage data with cargo tarpaulin..."
cargo tarpaulin --out lcov --output-dir target/coverage --timeout 120

# First, analyze the codebase with coverage data and capture initial debt score
echo "Initial analysis with coverage:"
if [ -f "target/coverage/lcov.info" ]; then
    debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info | tee /tmp/debtmap_initial.txt
else
    echo "Warning: LCOV file not found, running analysis without coverage data"
    debtmap analyze . | tee /tmp/debtmap_initial.txt
fi
INITIAL_SCORE=$(grep "Total debt score:" /tmp/debtmap_initial.txt | sed -E 's/.*Total debt score: ([0-9]+).*/\1/')
echo "Initial debt score: $INITIAL_SCORE"

# After fixing, verify everything works
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check

# Run debtmap again with coverage data to get the new debt score
echo "Final analysis with coverage:"
if [ -f "target/coverage/lcov.info" ]; then
    debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info | tee /tmp/debtmap_final.txt
else
    echo "Warning: LCOV file not found, running analysis without coverage data"
    debtmap analyze . | tee /tmp/debtmap_final.txt
fi
FINAL_SCORE=$(grep "Total debt score:" /tmp/debtmap_final.txt | sed -E 's/.*Total debt score: ([0-9]+).*/\1/')
echo "Final debt score: $FINAL_SCORE"

# Calculate the change
SCORE_CHANGE=$((INITIAL_SCORE - FINAL_SCORE))
if [ $SCORE_CHANGE -gt 0 ]; then
    CHANGE_MESSAGE="Reduced debt score by $SCORE_CHANGE (from $INITIAL_SCORE to $FINAL_SCORE)"
elif [ $SCORE_CHANGE -lt 0 ]; then
    CHANGE_MESSAGE="Increased debt score by $((-SCORE_CHANGE)) (from $INITIAL_SCORE to $FINAL_SCORE)"
else
    CHANGE_MESSAGE="Debt score unchanged at $FINAL_SCORE"
fi

# Commit with clear message about tech debt reduction
git add -A
if [[ $CHANGE_MESSAGE == *"testing"* || $CHANGE_MESSAGE == *"coverage"* ]]; then
    CATEGORY="Testing coverage (ROI optimization)"
    git commit -m "test: [description of tests added]

- [Specific test cases implemented]
- [Coverage improvement achieved]  
- $CHANGE_MESSAGE

Tech debt category: $CATEGORY"
else
    CATEGORY="Complexity reduction (refactoring)"
    git commit -m "fix: [description of complexity reduction]

- [Specific refactoring improvements made]
- [Impact on code quality and maintainability]
- $CHANGE_MESSAGE

Tech debt category: $CATEGORY"
fi
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Coverage data generated with cargo tarpaulin
- [ ] Initial debtmap analysis with coverage completed and baseline score captured
- [ ] Top priority issue identified using debtmap's ROI-based testing recommendations first
- [ ] Appropriate fix applied (testing for high-ROI opportunities, refactoring for complexity hotspots)
- [ ] All tests passing (including any newly written tests)
- [ ] No clippy warnings
- [ ] Code formatted properly
- [ ] Final debtmap analysis with coverage shows debt score improvement
- [ ] Changes committed with appropriate commit type (test: vs fix:) and descriptive message
