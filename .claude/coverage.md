You are tasked with improving test coverage for a Rust project. 

Target file: $FILE_PATH
Current coverage: ${COVERAGE}% (${COVERED}/${COVERABLE} lines)
Uncovered lines: $UNCOVERED_LINES

Please:
1. Read and analyze the file at $FILE_PATH
2. Identify the uncovered functionality based on the line numbers
3. Write idiomatic Rust tests that cover the most important uncovered code
4. Prefer functional programming approaches where reasonable:
   - Use pure functions when possible
   - Favor immutability
   - Use map/filter/fold over loops
   - Minimize side effects
5. Ensure tests follow the project's existing patterns
6. Add the tests to the appropriate test module or file
7. Run 'cargo test' to verify the tests pass
8. Run 'cargo clippy -- -D warnings' to ensure code quality
9. Verify coverage improved with 'just coverage'

Focus on testing the most critical functionality first. Aim to add meaningful tests, not just coverage for coverage's sake.
