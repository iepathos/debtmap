# Why Debtmap?

Technical debt analysis tools are everywhere. So why another one? Debtmap takes a fundamentally different approach to code quality analysis—one that reduces false positives and gives you actionable insights instead of just flagging "complex" code.

## The Problem with Traditional Static Analysis

Most static analysis tools flag code as "complex" based purely on metrics like cyclomatic complexity or lines of code. The problem? Not all complexity is equal.

Consider this common pattern:

```rust
fn validate_config(config: &Config) -> Result<()> {
    if config.output_dir.is_none() {
        return Err(anyhow!("output_dir required"))
    }
    if config.max_workers.is_none() {
        return Err(anyhow!("max_workers required"))
    }
    if config.timeout_secs.is_none() {
        return Err(anyhow!("timeout_secs required"))
    }
    if config.log_level.is_none() {
        return Err(anyhow!("log_level required"))
    }
    if config.cache_dir.is_none() {
        return Err(anyhow!("cache_dir required"))
    }
    // ... 15 more similar checks
    Ok(())
}
```

**Traditional tools say:** "Cyclomatic complexity: 20 - CRITICAL! Refactor immediately!"

**Reality:** This is a simple validation function with a repetitive pattern. Yes, it has 20 branches, but they're all identical in structure. An experienced developer can read and understand this in seconds.

Now compare with this function:

```rust
fn reconcile_state(current: &State, desired: &State) -> Vec<Action> {
    let mut actions = vec![];

    match (current.mode, desired.mode) {
        (Mode::Active, Mode::Standby) => {
            if current.has_active_connections() {
                actions.push(Action::DrainConnections);
                actions.push(Action::WaitForDrain);
            }
            actions.push(Action::TransitionToStandby);
        }
        (Mode::Standby, Mode::Active) => {
            if desired.requires_warmup() {
                actions.push(Action::Warmup);
            }
            actions.push(Action::TransitionToActive);
        }
        (Mode::Active, Mode::Maintenance) => {
            // Complex state transitions based on multiple conditions
            if current.has_pending_operations() {
                if desired.force_maintenance {
                    actions.push(Action::AbortPending);
                } else {
                    actions.push(Action::FinishPending);
                }
            }
            actions.push(Action::TransitionToMaintenance);
        }
        // ... more complex state transitions
        _ => {}
    }

    actions
}
```

**Traditional tools say:** "Cyclomatic complexity: 8 - moderate"

**Reality:** This function involves complex state machine logic with conditional transitions, side effects, and non-obvious control flow. It's genuinely complex and error-prone.

**The key insight:** Traditional metrics treat both functions equally, but they're fundamentally different in terms of cognitive load and risk.

## Debtmap's Unique Approach

### 1. Entropy-Based Complexity Analysis

Debtmap uses information theory to distinguish between genuinely complex code and repetitive pattern-based code.

**How it works:**
- Calculate the **variety** of code patterns in a function
- High variety (many different patterns) = high entropy = genuinely complex
- Low variety (repetitive patterns) = low entropy = simple despite high branch count

**Applied to our examples:**

```
validate_config():
- Cyclomatic complexity: 20
- Pattern entropy: 0.3 (low - all branches identical)
- Entropy-adjusted complexity: 5
- Assessment: Low risk despite high branch count

reconcile_state():
- Cyclomatic complexity: 8
- Pattern entropy: 0.85 (high - diverse conditional logic)
- Entropy-adjusted complexity: 9
- Assessment: High risk - genuinely complex logic
```

This approach **reduces false positives by 60-75%** compared to traditional cyclomatic complexity metrics.

### 2. Coverage-Risk Correlation

Debtmap is the only Rust analysis tool that natively combines code complexity with test coverage to compute risk scores.

**Why this matters:**
- Complex code with good tests = managed risk
- Simple code without tests = unmanaged risk (but low priority)
- Complex code without tests = CRITICAL gap

**Example:**

```rust
// Function A: Complex but well-tested
fn parse_query(sql: &str) -> Result<Query> {
    // Complexity: 15, Coverage: 95%
    // Risk Score: 3.2 (moderate - complexity managed by tests)
}

// Function B: Moderate complexity, no tests
fn apply_migrations(db: &mut Database) -> Result<()> {
    // Complexity: 8, Coverage: 0%
    // Risk Score: 8.9 (critical - untested with moderate complexity)
}
```

Debtmap integrates with LCOV coverage data to automatically prioritize Function B over Function A, even though A is more complex. This is because the risk is about **untested complexity**, not just complexity alone.

**Comparison:**

| Tool | Complexity | Coverage | Risk Score |
|------|------------|----------|------------|
| SonarQube | ✅ | ⚠️ (Enterprise only) | ❌ |
| CodeClimate | ✅ | ⚠️ (Separate) | ❌ |
| Debtmap | ✅ | ✅ (Built-in) | ✅ |

### 3. Actionable Recommendations

Most tools tell you **what** is wrong. Debtmap tells you **what to do about it** and **what impact it will have**.

**Compare:**

**SonarQube:**
```
Function 'process_request' has complexity 15 (threshold: 10)
Severity: Major
```

**Debtmap:**
```
#1 SCORE: 8.9 [CRITICAL]
├─ TEST GAP: ./src/handlers.rs:127 process_request()
├─ ACTION: Add 8 unit tests for full coverage
├─ IMPACT: -5.2 risk reduction
├─ WHY: Complex logic (cyclo=15) with 0% coverage
└─ SUGGEST: Extract validation to separate functions, test each independently
```

Debtmap tells you:
- **Specific location** (file:line)
- **Quantified gap** (8 missing tests)
- **Expected impact** (-5.2 risk reduction)
- **Rationale** (complexity + no coverage)
- **Refactoring suggestions** (extract functions)

### 4. Context-Aware Analysis

Debtmap understands that not all code needs the same level of scrutiny.

**Entry Points:** Main functions, CLI handlers, and framework integration points are typically tested via integration tests, not unit tests. Debtmap's analysis accounts for this:

```rust
// Entry point - flagged as low priority for unit test coverage
fn main() {
    // Debtmap: "Integration test coverage expected - low priority"
}

// Core business logic - flagged as high priority
fn calculate_risk_score(metrics: &Metrics) -> f64 {
    // Debtmap: "High complexity + low coverage = CRITICAL"
}
```

**Call Graph Analysis:** Debtmap traces function dependencies to prioritize functions called by many untested paths:

```
parse_input() [untested]
  ├─ called by: main() [integration tested]
  └─ called by: process_batch() [untested]

Priority: HIGH (called from untested code path)
```

### 5. Performance

Debtmap is written in Rust and uses parallel processing for analysis. This makes it **10-100x faster** than JVM-based tools like SonarQube.

**Benchmark (medium-sized Rust project, ~50k LOC):**
- SonarQube: 3-4 minutes
- CodeClimate: 2-3 minutes
- Debtmap: 5-8 seconds

This speed advantage means you can run debtmap in your local development workflow without breaking flow, not just in CI.

## When to Use Debtmap vs Alternatives

Debtmap isn't meant to replace all other tools—it complements them. Here's when to use what:

| Use Case | Recommended Tool | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Fast local Rust analysis | **Debtmap** | Native Rust, entropy analysis, coverage integration |
| Idiomatic Rust linting | **clippy** | Rust-specific patterns and best practices |
| Security vulnerability scanning | **cargo-audit** / **cargo-geiger** | Dependency vulnerabilities and unsafe code |
| Enterprise multi-language | **SonarQube** | Broad language support, centralized dashboards |
| Simple code smell detection | **CodeClimate** | Easy setup, broad plugin ecosystem |
| Test coverage reporting | **tarpaulin** + Debtmap | Coverage generation + risk analysis |

**Recommended workflow:**
1. **Development loop:** Run `clippy` and `debtmap` locally before commits
2. **PR validation:** Run `clippy`, `cargo test`, `debtmap validate` in CI
3. **Weekly reviews:** Use debtmap to identify high-priority refactoring targets
4. **Security audits:** Use `cargo-audit` and `cargo-geiger` periodically

## Should I Replace X with Debtmap?

**Replacing clippy?** No. Use both. Clippy catches idiomatic issues and common mistakes. Debtmap prioritizes technical debt based on risk.

**Replacing SonarQube?** Maybe. If you're working on a Rust-only project and need fast local analysis with coverage integration, yes. If you need multi-language support or enterprise features, no.

**Replacing test coverage tools?** No. Debtmap integrates with coverage tools (like tarpaulin) but doesn't replace them. Use tarpaulin to generate coverage, then use debtmap to prioritize gaps.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Entropy analysis** - Reduces false positives from repetitive code
2. **Native coverage integration** - Built-in LCOV support for risk scoring
3. **Actionable recommendations** - Specific steps with quantified impact
4. **Context-aware** - Understands entry points, call graphs, and testing patterns
5. **Fast** - Rust performance for local development workflow
6. **Tiered prioritization** - Critical/High/Moderate/Low classification with clear rationale
