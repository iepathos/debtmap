# Overview

Debtmap analyzes code through multiple lenses to provide a comprehensive view of technical health:

- **Complexity Metrics** - Quantifies how difficult code is to understand and test
- **Debt Patterns** - Identifies 13 types of technical debt requiring attention
- **Risk Scoring** - Correlates complexity with test coverage to find truly risky code
- **Prioritization** - Ranks findings by impact to guide refactoring efforts

The goal is to move beyond simple "here are your problems" to "here's what to fix first and why."
