# Coverage Integration

Coverage integration is one of Debtmap's most powerful capabilities, enabling **risk-based prioritization** by correlating complexity metrics with test coverage. This helps you identify truly risky code—functions that are both complex and untested—rather than just highlighting complex but well-tested functions.

## Why Coverage Matters

Without coverage data, complexity analysis shows you *what's complex*, but not *what's risky*. A complex function with 100% test coverage poses far less risk than a simple function with 0% coverage on a critical path.

Coverage integration transforms Debtmap from a complexity analyzer into a **risk assessment tool**:

- **Prioritize testing efforts**: Focus on high-complexity functions with low coverage
- **Validate refactoring safety**: See which complex code is already protected by tests
- **Risk-based sprint planning**: Surface truly risky code ahead of well-tested complexity
- **Quantify risk reduction**: Measure how coverage improvements reduce project risk

## LCOV Format: The Universal Standard

Debtmap uses the **LCOV format** for coverage data. LCOV is a language-agnostic standard supported by virtually all coverage tools across all major languages.

### Why LCOV?

- **Universal compatibility**: Works with Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and more
- **Tool independence**: Not tied to any specific test framework
- **Simple text format**: Easy to inspect and debug
- **Widely supported**: Generated by most modern coverage tools

### LCOV File Structure

An LCOV file contains line-by-line coverage information:

```lcov
SF:src/analyzer.rs
FN:42,calculate_complexity
FNDA:15,calculate_complexity
DA:42,15
DA:43,15
DA:44,12
DA:45,0
LH:3
LF:4
end_of_record
```

- `SF:` - Source file path
- `FN:` - Function name and starting line
- `FNDA:` - Function execution count
- `DA:` - Line execution data (line number, hit count)
- `LH:` - Lines hit
- `LF:` - Lines found (total)

## Generating Coverage Data

### Rust: cargo-tarpaulin

**Installation:**
```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

**Generate LCOV:**
```bash
cargo tarpaulin --out lcov --output-dir target/coverage
```

**Analyze with Debtmap:**
```bash
debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info
```

**Common Issues:**
- Ensure tests compile before running tarpaulin
- Use `--ignore-tests` if tests themselves show up in coverage
- Check paths match your project structure (relative to project root)

### JavaScript/TypeScript: Jest

**Configuration (package.json or jest.config.js):**
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "coverageReporters": ["lcov", "text"]
  }
}
```

**Generate Coverage:**
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

**Analyze with Debtmap:**
```bash
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage/lcov.info
```

### Python: pytest-cov

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install pytest-cov
```

**Generate LCOV:**
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=lcov
```

**Analyze with Debtmap:**
```bash
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.lcov
```

### Go: go test with gocover-cobertura

**Generate Coverage:**
```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
gocover-cobertura < coverage.out > coverage.xml
# Convert to LCOV using lcov tools
```

**Note**: Go's native coverage format requires conversion. Most CI systems support LCOV conversion plugins.

## How Coverage Affects Scoring

Coverage data fundamentally changes how Debtmap calculates debt scores. The scoring system operates in **two different modes** depending on whether coverage data is available.

### Scoring Modes

**Mode 1: With Coverage Data (Dampening Multiplier)**

When you provide an LCOV file with `--lcov`, coverage acts as a **dampening multiplier** that reduces scores for well-tested code:

```
Base Score = (Complexity Factor × 0.50) + (Dependency Factor × 0.25)
Coverage Multiplier = 1.0 - coverage_percentage
Final Score = Base Score × Coverage Multiplier
```

This is the **current implementation** as of spec 122. Coverage dampens the base score rather than contributing as an additive component.

**Mode 2: Without Coverage Data (Weighted Sum)**

When no coverage data is available, Debtmap falls back to a weighted sum model:

```
Final Score = (Coverage × 0.50) + (Complexity × 0.35) + (Dependency × 0.15)
```

In this mode, coverage is assumed to be 0% (worst case), giving it a weight of 50% in the total score. See `src/priority/scoring/calculation.rs:119-129` for the implementation.

### Coverage Dampening Multiplier

When coverage data is provided, it acts as a **multiplier** that dampens the base score:

```
Coverage Multiplier = 1.0 - coverage_percentage
Final Score = Base Score × Coverage Multiplier
```

**Examples:**

| Base Score | Coverage | Multiplier | Final Score | Priority |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| 8.5 | 100% | 0.0 | 0.0 | Minimal (well-tested) |
| 8.5 | 50% | 0.5 | 4.25 | Medium |
| 8.5 | 0% | 1.0 | 8.5 | High (untested) |

**Key Insight**: Complex but well-tested code automatically drops in priority, while untested complex code rises to the top.

**Special Cases:**
- **Test functions**: Coverage multiplier = 0.0 (tests get near-zero scores regardless of complexity)
- **Entry points**: Handled through semantic classification (FunctionRole) system with role multipliers, not coverage-specific weighting

**Invariant**: Total debt score with coverage ≤ total debt score without coverage.

**Implementation**: See `src/priority/scoring/calculation.rs:68-82` for the coverage dampening calculation.

## Transitive Coverage Propagation

Debtmap doesn't just look at *direct* coverage—it propagates coverage through the **call graph** using transitive analysis.

### How It Works

A function's effective coverage considers:
1. **Direct coverage**: Lines executed by tests
2. **Caller coverage**: Coverage of functions that call this function

```
Transitive Coverage = Direct Coverage + Σ(Caller Coverage × Weight)
```

### Why It Matters

A function with 0% direct coverage might have high transitive coverage if it's only called by well-tested functions:

```rust
// direct_coverage = 0%
// But called only by `process_request` (100% coverage)
// → transitive_coverage = 85%
fn validate_input(data: &str) -> bool {
    data.len() > 0
}

// direct_coverage = 100%
fn process_request(input: String) -> Result<()> {
    if !validate_input(&input) {
        return Err("Invalid");
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Effect**: `validate_input` has reduced urgency because it's only reachable through well-tested code paths.

## Performance Characteristics

Coverage integration is highly optimized for large codebases:

- **Index Build**: O(n), ~20-30ms for 5,000 functions
- **Exact Lookup**: O(1), ~0.5μs per lookup
- **Fallback Lookup**: O(log n), ~5-8μs when exact match fails
- **Memory Usage**: ~200 bytes per record (~2MB for 5,000 functions)
- **Thread Safety**: Lock-free parallel access via `Arc<CoverageIndex>`
- **Analysis Overhead**: ~2.5x baseline (target: ≤3x)

**Result**: Coverage integration adds minimal overhead even on projects with thousands of functions.

**Implementation**: See `src/risk/coverage_index.rs:13-38` for the CoverageIndex struct and performance documentation.

## CLI Options Reference

### Primary Coverage Options

```bash
# Provide LCOV coverage file
debtmap analyze . --coverage-file path/to/lcov.info

# Shorthand alias
debtmap analyze . --lcov path/to/lcov.info
```

### Context Providers

Coverage can be combined with other context providers for nuanced risk assessment:

```bash
# Enable all context providers (includes coverage propagation)
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info --enable-context

# Specify specific providers
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info \
  --context-providers critical_path,dependency,git_history

# Disable specific providers
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info \
  --disable-context git_history
```

**Available Context Providers**:
- `critical_path`: Identifies functions on critical execution paths
- `dependency`: Analyzes dependency relationships and impact
- `git_history`: Uses change frequency from version control

See [Scoring Strategies](scoring-strategies.md) for details on how these combine.

### Validate Command Support

The `validate` command also supports coverage integration for risk-based quality gates:

```bash
# Fail CI builds if untested complex code exceeds thresholds
debtmap validate . --lcov coverage.info --max-debt-density 50
```

See [CLI Reference](cli-reference.md) for complete validation options.

## Troubleshooting Coverage Integration

### Coverage Not Correlating with Functions

**Symptoms**:
- Debtmap shows 0% coverage for all functions
- Warning: "No coverage data correlated with analyzed functions"

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify LCOV Format**:
```bash
head coverage.info
# Should show: SF:, FN:, DA: lines
```

2. **Check Path Matching**:
Coverage file paths must be relative to project root:
```bash
# Good: SF:src/analyzer.rs
# Bad:  SF:/home/user/project/src/analyzer.rs
```

3. **Enable Verbose Logging**:
```bash
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info -vv
```
This shows coverage lookup details for each function.

4. **Verify Coverage Tool Output**:
```bash
# Ensure your coverage tool generated line data (DA: records)
grep "^DA:" coverage.info | head
```

### Functions Still Show Up Despite 100% Coverage

**This is expected behavior** when:
- Function has high complexity (cyclomatic > 10)
- Function has other debt issues (duplication, nesting, etc.)
- You're viewing function-level output (coverage dampens but doesn't eliminate)

**Coverage reduces priority but doesn't hide issues**. Use filters to focus:
```bash
# Show only critical and high priority items
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info --min-priority high

# Show top 10 most urgent items
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info --top 10
```

### Coverage File Path Issues

**Problem**: Can't find coverage file

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Use absolute path
debtmap analyze . --lcov /absolute/path/to/coverage.info

# Or ensure relative path is from project root
debtmap analyze . --lcov ./target/coverage/lcov.info
```

### LCOV Format Errors

**Problem**: "Invalid LCOV format" error

**Causes**:
- Non-LCOV format (Cobertura XML, JaCoCo, etc.)
- Corrupted file
- Wrong file encoding

**Solutions**:
- Verify your coverage tool is configured for LCOV output
- Check for binary/encoding issues: `file coverage.info`
- Regenerate coverage with explicit LCOV format flag

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for more debugging tips.

## Best Practices

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Generate Coverage Before Analysis**:
   ```bash
   # Rust example
   cargo tarpaulin --out lcov --output-dir target/coverage
   debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info
   ```

2. **Use Coverage for Sprint Planning**:
   ```bash
   # Focus on untested complex code
   debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info --top 20
   ```

3. **Combine with Tiered Prioritization**:
   Coverage automatically feeds into [Tiered Prioritization](tiered-prioritization.md):
   - **Tier 1**: Architectural issues (less affected by coverage)
   - **Tier 2**: Complex untested code (coverage < 50%, complexity > 15)
   - **Tier 3**: Testing gaps (coverage < 80%, complexity 10-15)

4. **Validate Refactoring Impact**:
   ```bash
   # Before refactoring
   debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage-before.info -o before.json

   # After refactoring
   debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage-after.info -o after.json

   # Compare
   debtmap compare --before before.json --after after.json
   ```

### Testing Strategy

**Prioritize testing based on risk**:

1. **High Complexity + Low Coverage = Highest Priority**:
   ```bash
   debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info \
     --filter Risk --min-priority high
   ```

2. **Focus on Business Logic**:
   Entry points and infrastructure code have natural coverage patterns. Focus unit tests on business logic functions.

3. **Use Dependency Analysis**:
   ```bash
   debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info \
     --context-providers dependency -vv
   ```
   Tests high-dependency functions first—they have the most impact.

4. **Don't Over-Test Entry Points**:
   Entry points (main, handlers) are better tested with integration tests, not unit tests. Debtmap applies role multipliers through its semantic classification system (FunctionRole) to adjust scoring for different function types. See `src/priority/unified_scorer.rs:149` and `src/priority/scoring/classification.rs` for the classification system.

### Configuration

In `.debtmap.toml`:

```toml
[scoring]
# Default weights for scoring WITHOUT coverage data
# When coverage data IS provided, it acts as a dampening multiplier instead
coverage = 0.50  # Default: 50% (only used when no LCOV provided)
complexity = 0.35  # Default: 35%
dependency = 0.15  # Default: 15%

[thresholds]
# Set minimum risk score to filter low-priority items
minimum_risk_score = 15.0

# Skip simple functions even if uncovered
minimum_cyclomatic_complexity = 5
```

**Important**: These weights only apply when coverage data is **not** available. When you provide `--lcov`, coverage acts as a dampening multiplier instead of a weighted component. See `src/config.rs:122-132` for default weight definitions.

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for complete options.

### CI Integration

**Example GitHub Actions Workflow**:

```yaml
- name: Generate Coverage
  run: cargo tarpaulin --out lcov --output-dir target/coverage

- name: Analyze with Debtmap
  run: |
    debtmap analyze . \
      --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info \
      --format json \
      --output debtmap-report.json

- name: Validate Quality Gates
  run: |
    debtmap validate . \
      --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info \
      --max-debt-density 50
```

**Quality Gate Strategy**:
- Fail builds on new critical debt (Tier 1 architectural issues)
- Warn on new high-priority untested code (Tier 2)
- Track coverage trends over time with `compare` command

## FAQ

### Why does my 100% covered function still show up?

Coverage dampens debt scores but doesn't eliminate debt. A function with cyclomatic complexity 25 and 100% coverage still represents technical debt—it's just lower priority than untested complex code.

**Use filters to focus on high-priority items**:
```bash
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info --top 10
```

### What's the difference between direct and transitive coverage?

- **Direct coverage**: Lines executed directly by tests
- **Transitive coverage**: Coverage considering call graph (functions called by well-tested code)

Transitive coverage reduces urgency for functions only reachable through well-tested paths.

### Should I test everything to 100% coverage?

**No.** Use Debtmap's risk scores to prioritize:
1. Test high-complexity, low-coverage functions first
2. Entry points are better tested with integration tests
3. Simple utility functions (complexity < 5) may not need dedicated unit tests

Debtmap helps you achieve **optimal coverage**, not maximal coverage.

### How do I debug coverage correlation issues?

Use verbose logging:
```bash
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage.info -vv
```

This shows:
- Coverage file parsing details
- Function-to-coverage correlation attempts
- Path matching diagnostics

### Can I use coverage with validate command?

Yes! The `validate` command supports `--lcov` for risk-based quality gates:
```bash
debtmap validate . --lcov coverage.info --max-debt-density 50
```

See [CLI Reference](cli-reference.md#validate-command) for details.
