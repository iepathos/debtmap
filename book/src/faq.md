# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about debtmap's features, usage, and comparison with other tools.

## Features & Capabilities

### What is entropy-based complexity analysis?

Entropy analysis uses information theory to distinguish between genuinely complex code and repetitive pattern-based code. Traditional cyclomatic complexity counts branches, but not all branches are equal in cognitive load.

For example, a function with 20 identical if/return validation checks has the same cyclomatic complexity as a function with 20 diverse conditional branches handling different business logic. Entropy analysis gives the validation function a much lower effective complexity score because it follows a simple, repetitive pattern.

**Result:** 60-75% reduction in false positives compared to traditional complexity metrics.

### How does coverage integration work?

Debtmap reads LCOV format coverage data (generated by tools like `cargo-tarpaulin`, `pytest-cov`, or `jest`) and maps it to specific functions and branches. It then combines coverage percentages with complexity metrics to calculate risk scores.

**Key insight:** A complex function with good test coverage is lower risk than a moderately complex function with no tests.

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Generate coverage data
cargo tarpaulin --out lcov --output-dir target/coverage

# Analyze with coverage integration
debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info
```

[See examples in Analysis Guide](analysis-guide.md#coverage-integrated-analysis)

### What languages are supported?

**Full support:**
- Rust (via `syn` crate - complete AST analysis)
- Python (via `rustpython` - full Python 3.x support)

**Partial support:**
- JavaScript (via `tree-sitter` - ES6+, JSX)
- TypeScript (via `tree-sitter` - basic support)

**Planned:**
- Go (target: Q2 2025)
- Java (target: Q3 2025)
- C/C++ (target: Q4 2025)

Language support means: AST parsing, metric extraction, complexity calculation, and pattern detection.

### Can I customize the complexity thresholds?

Yes! Configure thresholds in `.debtmap.toml`:

```toml
[thresholds]
cyclomatic_complexity = 10      # Flag functions above this
nesting_depth = 3               # Maximum nesting levels
loc = 200                       # Maximum lines per function
parameter_count = 4             # Maximum parameters

[scoring]
critical_threshold = 8.0        # Risk score for Critical tier
high_threshold = 5.0            # Risk score for High tier
moderate_threshold = 2.0        # Risk score for Moderate tier
```

See [Configuration](configuration.md#thresholds) for all available options.

### Does debtmap integrate with CI/CD?

Yes! Use the `validate` command to enforce quality gates:

```bash
# Fail build if critical or high-tier debt detected
debtmap validate . --max-critical 0 --max-high 5

# Exit codes:
# 0 = validation passed
# 1 = validation failed (debt exceeds thresholds)
# 2 = analysis error
```

**GitHub Actions example:**
```yaml
- name: Check technical debt
  run: |
    cargo tarpaulin --out lcov --output-dir target/coverage
    debtmap validate . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info \
      --max-critical 0 --max-high 10 \
      --format json --output debt-report.json

- name: Comment on PR
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    script: |
      const report = require('./debt-report.json');
      // Post report as PR comment
```

See [Prodigy Integration](prodigy-integration.md) for more CI/CD patterns.

**When to use debtmap:** Rust projects, privacy-sensitive code, fast local analysis, entropy-based scoring.

### Should I replace clippy with debtmap?

**No—use both!** They serve different purposes:

**clippy:**
- Focuses on idiomatic Rust patterns
- Catches common mistakes (e.g., unnecessary clones, inefficient iterators)
- Suggests Rust-specific best practices
- Runs in milliseconds

**debtmap:**
- Focuses on technical debt prioritization
- Identifies untested complex code
- Combines complexity with test coverage
- Provides quantified recommendations

**Recommended workflow:**
```bash
# Fix clippy issues first (quick wins)
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Then prioritize debt with debtmap
debtmap analyze . --lcov coverage/lcov.info --top 10
```

### Should I replace cargo-audit with debtmap?

**No—different focus.** cargo-audit scans for security vulnerabilities in dependencies. Debtmap analyzes code complexity and test coverage.

**Use both:**
- `cargo-audit` - Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- `cargo-geiger` - Unsafe code detection
- `debtmap` - Technical debt and test gaps

### How does debtmap compare to traditional code coverage tools?

Debtmap doesn't replace coverage tools—it **augments** them.

**Coverage tools (tarpaulin, pytest-cov, jest):**
- Measure what % of code is executed by tests
- Tell you "you have 75% coverage"

**Debtmap:**
- Reads coverage data from these tools
- Prioritizes gaps based on code complexity
- Tells you "function X has 0% coverage and complexity 12—fix this first"

**Value:** Debtmap answers "which 25% should I test first?" instead of just "75% is tested."

## Usage & Configuration

### Why don't entry points need 100% coverage?

Entry points (main functions, CLI handlers, framework integration code) are typically tested via **integration tests**, not unit tests. Unit testing them would mean mocking the entire runtime environment, which is brittle and low-value.

Debtmap recognizes common entry point patterns and lowers their priority for unit test coverage:

```rust
// Entry point - integration test coverage expected
fn main() {
    // Debtmap: LOW priority for unit tests
}

// HTTP handler - integration test coverage expected
async fn handle_request(req: Request) -> Response {
    // Debtmap: LOW priority for unit tests
}

// Core business logic - unit test coverage expected
fn calculate_discount(cart: &Cart) -> Discount {
    // Debtmap: HIGH priority for unit tests if uncovered
}
```

You can configure entry point detection in `.debtmap.toml`:

```toml
[analysis]
entry_point_patterns = [
    "main",
    "handle_*",
    "run_*",
    "*_handler",
]
```

### How do I exclude test files from analysis?

By default, debtmap excludes common test directories. To customize:

**.debtmap.toml:**
```toml
[analysis]
exclude_patterns = [
    "**/tests/**",
    "**/*_test.rs",
    "**/test_*.py",
    "**/*.test.ts",
    "**/target/**",
    "**/node_modules/**",
]
```

**Command line:**
```bash
debtmap analyze . --exclude '**/tests/**' --exclude '**/*_test.rs'
```

### Can I analyze only specific files or directories?

Yes! Use the `--include` flag:

```bash
# Analyze only src/ directory
debtmap analyze . --include 'src/**'

# Analyze specific files
debtmap analyze . --include 'src/main.rs' --include 'src/lib.rs'

# Combine include and exclude
debtmap analyze . --include 'src/**' --exclude 'src/generated/**'
```

### How do I configure ignore patterns for generated code?

Add to `.debtmap.toml`:

```toml
[analysis]
exclude_patterns = [
    "**/generated/**",
    "**/*.g.rs",           # Generated Rust
    "**/*_pb.py",          # Protobuf generated Python
    "**/*.generated.ts",   # Generated TypeScript
]
```

Or use comments in source files:

```rust
// debtmap:ignore-file - entire file ignored

fn complex_function() {
    // debtmap:ignore-start
    // ... complex generated code ...
    // debtmap:ignore-end
}
```

### What if debtmap reports false positives?

**1. Verify entropy analysis is enabled** (default in v0.2.8+):
```toml
[analysis]
enable_entropy_analysis = true
```

**2. Adjust thresholds** for your project's needs:
```toml
[thresholds]
cyclomatic_complexity = 15  # Increase if you have many validation functions
```

**3. Use ignore comments** for specific functions:
```rust
// debtmap:ignore - explanation for why this is acceptable
fn complex_but_acceptable() {
    // ...
}
```

**4. Report false positives:** If you believe debtmap's analysis is incorrect, please [open an issue](https://github.com/prodigy-tools/debtmap/issues) with a code example. This helps improve the tool!

### How accurate is the risk scoring?

Risk scores are **relative prioritization metrics**, not absolute measures. They help you answer "which code should I focus on first?" rather than "exactly how risky is this code?"

**Factors affecting accuracy:**
- **Coverage data quality:** Accurate if your tests exercise realistic scenarios
- **Entropy analysis:** Effective for common patterns; may miss domain-specific patterns
- **Call graph:** More accurate within single files than across modules
- **Context:** Cannot account for business criticality (you know your domain best)

**Best practice:** Use risk scores for prioritization, but apply your domain knowledge when deciding what to actually refactor or test.

### Can I run debtmap on a CI server?

Yes! Debtmap is designed for CI/CD pipelines:

**Performance:**
- Statically linked binary (no runtime dependencies)
- Fast analysis (seconds, not minutes)
- Low memory footprint

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - Analysis succeeded, validation passed
- `1` - Analysis succeeded, validation failed (debt thresholds exceeded)
- `2` - Analysis error (parse failure, invalid config, etc.)

**Example CI configuration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/debt-check.yml
name: Technical Debt Check

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  debt-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install debtmap
        run: cargo install debtmap

      - name: Generate coverage
        run: cargo tarpaulin --out lcov

      - name: Analyze debt
        run: debtmap validate . --lcov lcov.info --max-critical 0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Analysis is slow on my large codebase

**Optimization strategies:**

**1. Exclude unnecessary files:**
```toml
[analysis]
exclude_patterns = [
    "**/target/**",
    "**/node_modules/**",
    "**/vendor/**",
    "**/.git/**",
]
```

**2. Use incremental mode** (cache results for unchanged files):
```bash
debtmap analyze . --incremental --cache-dir .debtmap-cache
```

**3. Analyze specific directories:**
```bash
# Only analyze src/, skip examples and benches
debtmap analyze src/
```

**4. Reduce parallelism** if memory-constrained:
```bash
debtmap analyze . --jobs 4
```

**Expected performance:**
- 50k LOC: 5-15 seconds
- 200k LOC: 30-90 seconds
- 1M+ LOC: 3-8 minutes

If analysis is significantly slower, please [report a performance issue](https://github.com/prodigy-tools/debtmap/issues).

### Debtmap crashes with "stack overflow"

This typically happens with extremely deep call stacks or heavily nested code.

**Solutions:**

**1. Increase stack size:**
```bash
# Linux/macOS
RUST_MIN_STACK=8388608 debtmap analyze .

# Windows PowerShell
$env:RUST_MIN_STACK=8388608; debtmap analyze .
```

**2. Exclude problematic files:**
```bash
debtmap analyze . --exclude 'path/to/deeply/nested/file.rs'
```

**3. Report the issue:** If you encounter stack overflows, please report with a minimal reproducible example.

### Coverage data isn't being applied

**Check:**

**1. LCOV file path is correct:**
```bash
debtmap analyze . --lcov target/coverage/lcov.info
```

**2. LCOV file contains data:**
```bash
grep -c "^SF:" target/coverage/lcov.info  # Should be > 0
```

**3. Source paths match:**
LCOV file paths must match your source file paths. If you generate coverage in a different directory:

```toml
[coverage]
source_root = "/path/to/project"  # Rewrite LCOV paths
```

**4. Enable debug logging:**
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug debtmap analyze . --lcov lcov.info 2>&1 | grep -i coverage
```

### Debtmap reports "No functions found"

**Common causes:**

**1. Wrong language detection:**
```bash
# Verify file extensions are recognized
debtmap analyze . --verbose
```

**2. Syntax errors preventing parsing:**
```bash
# Check for parse errors
RUST_LOG=warn debtmap analyze .
```

**3. All files excluded by ignore patterns:**
```bash
# List files being analyzed
debtmap analyze . --dry-run
```

**4. Unsupported language features:**
Some cutting-edge syntax may not parse correctly. Report parsing issues with code examples.

## Advanced Topics

### Can I extend debtmap with custom analyzers?

Not yet, but planned for v0.3.0. You'll be able to implement the `Analyzer` trait for custom language support or domain-specific pattern detection.

**Roadmap:**
- v0.3.0: Plugin API for custom analyzers
- v0.4.0: Plugin API for custom scoring strategies
- v0.5.0: Plugin API for custom output formatters

Track progress in [issue #42](https://github.com/prodigy-tools/debtmap/issues/42).

### How does debtmap handle monorepos?

**Workspace support:**
Debtmap analyzes each workspace member independently by default:

```bash
# Analyze entire workspace
debtmap analyze .

# Analyze specific member
debtmap analyze packages/api

# Combined report for all members
debtmap analyze . --workspace-mode combined
```

**Configuration:**
```toml
[workspace]
members = ["packages/*", "services/*"]
exclude = ["examples/*"]
```

### Can I compare debt between branches or commits?

Yes! Use the `compare` command:

```bash
# Compare current branch with main
debtmap compare main

# Compare two specific commits
debtmap compare abc123..def456

# Show only new debt introduced
debtmap compare main --show-new-only
```

Output shows:
- New debt items (introduced since base)
- Resolved debt items (fixed since base)
- Changed debt items (score increased/decreased)

See [Examples - Comparing Branches](examples.md#comparing-branches) for details.

### How do I integrate debtmap with my editor?

**VS Code:**
- Install the "Debtmap" extension (planned for Q2 2025)
- Inline warnings in editor for high-risk code
- Quick fixes to generate test stubs
