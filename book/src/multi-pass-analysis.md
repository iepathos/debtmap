# Multi-Pass Analysis

Multi-pass analysis is an advanced feature that performs two separate complexity analyses on your code to distinguish between genuine logical complexity and complexity artifacts introduced by code formatting. By comparing raw and normalized versions of your code, debtmap can attribute complexity to specific sources and provide actionable insights for refactoring.

## Overview

Traditional complexity analysis treats all code as-is, which means formatting choices like multiline expressions, whitespace, and indentation can artificially inflate complexity metrics. Multi-pass analysis solves this problem by:

1. **Raw Analysis** - Measures complexity of code exactly as written
2. **Normalized Analysis** - Measures complexity after removing formatting artifacts
3. **Attribution** - Compares the two analyses to identify complexity sources

The difference between raw and normalized complexity reveals how much "complexity" comes from formatting versus genuine logical complexity from control flow, branching, and nesting.

## How It Works

```

**Raw Analysis** examines your code as-is, capturing all complexity including:
- Logical control flow (if, loops, match, try/catch)
- Function calls and closures
- Formatting artifacts (multiline expressions, whitespace, indentation)

**Normalized Analysis** processes semantically equivalent code with standardized formatting:
- Removes excessive whitespace
- Normalizes multiline expressions to single lines where appropriate
- Standardizes indentation
- Preserves logical structure

**Attribution Engine** compares the results to categorize complexity sources:
- **Logical Complexity** - From control flow and branching (normalized result)
- **Formatting Artifacts** - From code formatting choices (difference between raw and normalized)
- **Pattern Complexity** - From recognized code patterns (error handling, validation, etc.)

> **Note**: Pattern complexity analysis is part of the standard multi-pass analysis. No additional configuration is required to enable pattern detection.

## CLI Usage

Enable multi-pass analysis with the `--multi-pass` flag:

```bash
# Basic multi-pass analysis
debtmap analyze . --multi-pass

# Multi-pass with detailed attribution breakdown
debtmap analyze . --multi-pass --attribution

# Control detail level
debtmap analyze . --multi-pass --attribution --detail-level comprehensive

# Output as JSON for tooling integration
debtmap analyze . --multi-pass --attribution --json
```

### Available Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--multi-pass` | Enable two-pass analysis (raw + normalized) |
| `--attribution` | Show detailed complexity attribution breakdown (requires `--multi-pass`) |
| `--detail-level <level>` | Set output detail: `summary`, `standard`, `comprehensive`, `debug` |
| `--json` | Output results in JSON format |

> **Note**: The `--attribution` flag requires `--multi-pass` to be enabled, as attribution depends on comparing raw and normalized analyses.

## Attribution Engine

The attribution engine breaks down complexity into three main categories, each with detailed tracking and suggestions.

### Logical Complexity

Represents inherent complexity from your code's control flow and structure:

- **Function complexity** - Cyclomatic and cognitive complexity per function
- **Control flow** - If statements, loops, match expressions
- **Error handling** - Try/catch blocks, Result/Option handling
- **Closures and callbacks** - Anonymous functions and callbacks
- **Nesting levels** - Depth of nested control structures

Each logical complexity component includes:
- **Contribution** - Complexity points from this construct
- **Location** - File, line, column, and span information
- **Suggestions** - Specific refactoring recommendations

Example:
```rust
// Function with high logical complexity
fn process_data(items: Vec<Item>) -> Result<Vec<Output>> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for item in items {                          // +1 (loop)
        if item.is_valid() {                     // +1 (if)
            match item.category {                // +1 (match)
                Category::A => {
                    if item.value > 100 {        // +2 (nested if)
                        results.push(transform_a(&item)?);
                    }
                }
                Category::B => {
                    results.push(transform_b(&item)?);
                }
                _ => continue,                   // +1 (match arm)
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(results)
}
// Logical complexity: ~7 points
```

### Formatting Artifacts

Identifies complexity introduced by code formatting choices:

- **Multiline expressions** - Long expressions split across multiple lines
- **Excessive whitespace** - Blank lines within code blocks
- **Inconsistent indentation** - Mixed tabs/spaces or irregular indentation
- **Line breaks in chains** - Method chains split across many lines

Formatting artifacts are categorized by severity:
- **Low** - Minor formatting inconsistencies (<10% impact)
- **Medium** - Noticeable formatting impact (10-25% impact)
- **High** - Significant complexity inflation (>25% impact)

Example:
```rust
// Same function with formatting that inflates complexity
fn process_data(
    items: Vec<Item>
) -> Result<Vec<Output>> {
    let mut results =
        Vec::new();

    for item in
        items
    {
        if item
            .is_valid()
        {
            match item
                .category
            {
                Category::A =>
                {
                    if item
                        .value
                        > 100
                    {
                        results
                            .push(
                                transform_a(
                                    &item
                                )?
                            );
                    }
                }
                Category::B =>
                {
                    results
                        .push(
                            transform_b(
                                &item
                            )?
                        );
                }
                _ => continue,
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(results)
}
// Raw complexity: ~12 points (formatting adds ~5 points)
// Normalized complexity: ~7 points (true logical complexity)
```

### Pattern Complexity

Recognizes common code patterns and their complexity characteristics:

- **Error handling patterns** - Result/Option propagation, error conversion
- **Validation patterns** - Input validation, constraint checking
- **Data transformation** - Map/filter/fold chains, data conversions
- **Builder patterns** - Fluent interfaces and builders
- **State machines** - Explicit state management

Each pattern includes:
- **Confidence score** (0.0-1.0) - How certain the pattern recognition is
- **Opportunities** - Suggestions for pattern extraction or improvement

Example:
```rust
// Error handling pattern (confidence: 0.85)
fn load_config(path: &Path) -> Result<Config> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(path)
        .context("Failed to read config file")?;

    let config: Config = serde_json::from_str(&contents)
        .context("Failed to parse config JSON")?;

    config.validate()
        .context("Config validation failed")?;

    Ok(config)
}
// Pattern complexity: moderate error handling overhead
// Suggestion: Consider error enum for better type safety
```

## Understanding Attribution Output

When you run with `--attribution`, you'll see a detailed breakdown:

```bash
$ debtmap analyze src/main.rs --multi-pass --attribution --detail-level comprehensive
```

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Considerations

Multi-pass analysis adds overhead compared to single-pass analysis, but debtmap monitors and limits this overhead.

### Performance Metrics

When performance tracking is enabled, you'll see:

```
Performance Metrics
-------------------
Raw analysis: 145ms
Normalized analysis: 132ms
Attribution: 45ms
Total time: 322ms
Memory used: 12.3 MB

Overhead: 121.7% vs single-pass (145ms baseline)
⚠️  Warning: Overhead exceeds 25% target
```

**Tracked Metrics:**
- **Raw analysis time** - Time to analyze original code
- **Normalized analysis time** - Time to analyze normalized code
- **Attribution time** - Time to compute attribution breakdown
- **Total time** - Complete multi-pass analysis duration
- **Memory used** - Additional memory for two-pass analysis

### Performance Overhead

**Target Overhead**: ≤25% compared to single-pass analysis

Multi-pass analysis aims to add no more than 25% overhead versus standard single-pass analysis. If overhead exceeds this threshold, a warning is issued.

**Typical Overhead:**
- Attribution adds ~10-15% on average
- Normalization adds ~5-10% on average
- Total overhead usually 15-25%

**Factors Affecting Performance:**
- **File size** - Larger files take proportionally longer
- **Complexity** - More complex code requires more analysis time
- **Language** - Some languages (TypeScript) are slower to parse
- **Parallel processing** - Overhead is per-file, parallel reduces impact

### Optimization Tips

**Enable Caching**
```bash
# Use shared cache for repeated analyses
debtmap analyze . --multi-pass --cache-location shared
```

**Disable Performance Tracking in Production**
```rust
MultiPassOptions {
    performance_tracking: false,  // Reduces overhead slightly
    ..Default::default()
}
```

**Use Parallel Processing**
```bash
# Parallel analysis amortizes overhead across cores
# Note: --jobs is a general debtmap flag controlling parallelism for all analysis
debtmap analyze . --multi-pass --jobs 8
```

**Target Specific Files**
```bash
# Analyze only files that need detailed attribution
debtmap analyze src/complex_module.rs --multi-pass --attribution
```

## Comparative Analysis

Multi-pass analysis supports comparing code changes to validate refactoring efforts.

### Basic Comparison

The `compare_complexity` function is a standalone convenience function that performs complete multi-pass analysis on both code versions and returns the computed differences:

```rust
use debtmap::analysis::multi_pass::compare_complexity;
use debtmap::core::Language;

let before_code = r#"
fn process(items: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    let mut sum = 0;
    for item in items {
        if item > 0 {
            if item % 2 == 0 {
                sum += item * 2;
            } else {
                sum += item;
            }
        }
    }
    sum
}
"#;

let after_code = r#"
fn process(items: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    items
        .into_iter()
        .filter(|&item| item > 0)
        .map(|item| if item % 2 == 0 { item * 2 } else { item })
        .sum()
}
"#;

let comparison = compare_complexity(before_code, after_code, Language::Rust)?;

println!("Complexity change: {}", comparison.complexity_change);
println!("Cognitive complexity change: {}", comparison.cognitive_change);
println!("Formatting impact change: {}", comparison.formatting_impact_change);
```

### Comparison Results

The `ComparativeAnalysis` struct contains the computed differences between before and after analyses:

```rust
pub struct ComparativeAnalysis {
    pub complexity_change: i32,        // Negative = improvement
    pub cognitive_change: i32,         // Negative = improvement
    pub formatting_impact_change: f32, // Negative = less formatting noise
    pub improvements: Vec<String>,
    pub regressions: Vec<String>,
}
```

> **Note**: The `compare_complexity` function performs both analyses internally and returns only the change metrics. To access the full before/after results, perform separate analyses using `MultiPassAnalyzer`.

**Interpreting Changes:**
- **Negative complexity change** - Refactoring reduced complexity ✓
- **Positive complexity change** - Refactoring increased complexity ✗
- **Improvements** - List of detected improvements (reduced nesting, extracted functions, etc.)
- **Regressions** - List of detected regressions (increased complexity, new anti-patterns, etc.)

### Example Output

```
Comparative Analysis
====================

Complexity Changes:
├─ Cyclomatic: 8 → 4 (-4, -50%)
├─ Cognitive: 12 → 5 (-7, -58.3%)
└─ Formatting Impact: 25% → 10% (-15%, -60%)

Improvements Detected:
✓ Reduced nesting depth (3 → 1)
✓ Eliminated mutable state
✓ Replaced imperative loop with functional chain
✓ Improved formatting consistency

No regressions detected.

Verdict: Refactoring reduced complexity by 50% and improved code clarity.
```

### When to Use Standard Analysis

**Quick Feedback**
- Fast complexity checks during development
- CI/CD gates that need speed
- Large codebases where overhead matters

**Sufficient Metrics**
- When overall complexity trends are enough
- No need for detailed attribution
- Formatting is already standardized

## Future Enhancements

### Spec 84: Detailed AST-Based Source Mapping

The current implementation uses estimated complexity locations based on function metrics. [Spec 84](https://github.com/yourusername/debtmap/blob/master/specs/84-detailed-ast-source-mapping.md) will enhance attribution with precise AST-based source mapping:

**Planned Improvements:**
- **Exact AST node locations** - Precise line, column, and span for each complexity point
- **100% accurate mapping** - No estimation, direct AST-to-source mapping
- **IDE integration** - Jump from complexity reports directly to source code
- **Inline visualization** - Show complexity heat maps in your editor
- **Statement-level tracking** - Complexity attribution at statement granularity

**Current vs Future:**

Current (estimated):
```rust
ComplexityComponent {
    location: CodeLocation {
        line: 45,      // Function start line
        column: 0,     // Estimated
        span: None,    // Not available
    },
    description: "Function: process_request",
}
```

Future (precise):
```rust
ComplexityComponent {
    location: SourceLocation {
        line: 47,           // Exact if statement line
        column: 8,          // Exact column
        span: Some(47, 52), // Exact span of construct
        ast_path: "fn::process_request::body::if[0]",
    },
    description: "If condition: item.is_valid()",
}
```

This will enable:
- Click-to-navigate from reports to exact code locations
- Visual Studio Code / IntelliJ integration for inline complexity display
- More precise refactoring suggestions
- Better complexity trend tracking at fine granularity

## Summary

Multi-pass analysis provides deep insights into your code's complexity by:

1. **Separating signal from noise** - Distinguishing logical complexity from formatting artifacts
2. **Attributing complexity sources** - Identifying what contributes to complexity and why
3. **Generating actionable insights** - Providing specific refactoring recommendations
4. **Validating refactoring** - Comparing before/after to prove complexity reduction
5. **Monitoring performance** - Ensuring overhead stays within acceptable bounds

Use `--multi-pass --attribution` when you need detailed complexity analysis and targeted refactoring guidance. The overhead (typically 15-25%) is worthwhile when you need to understand *why* code is complex and *how* to improve it.

For quick complexity checks and CI/CD integration, standard single-pass analysis is usually sufficient. Save multi-pass analysis for deep dives, refactoring validation, and complexity investigations.
