# Validation and Quality Gates

The `validate` command enforces quality gates in your development workflow, making it ideal for CI/CD integration. Unlike the `analyze` command which focuses on exploration and reporting, `validate` checks your codebase against configured thresholds and returns appropriate exit codes for automated workflows.

## Validate vs Analyze

Understanding when to use each command is crucial:

| Aspect | `validate` | `analyze` |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Enforce quality gates | Explore and understand debt |
| **Exit Codes** | Returns non-zero on failure | Always returns 0 (unless error) |
| **Thresholds** | From `.debtmap.toml` config | Command-line flags |
| **Use Case** | CI/CD pipelines, pre-commit hooks | Interactive analysis, reports |
| **Output Focus** | Pass/fail with violation details | Comprehensive metrics and insights |
| **Configuration** | Requires `.debtmap.toml` | Works without config file |

**Rule of thumb:** Use `validate` for automation and `analyze` for investigation.

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize configuration:**
   ```bash
   debtmap init
   ```

2. **Edit `.debtmap.toml` to set thresholds:**
   ```toml
   [thresholds.validation]
   max_debt_density = 50.0              # Debt items per 1000 LOC
   max_average_complexity = 10.0        # Average cyclomatic complexity
   max_codebase_risk_score = 7.0        # Overall risk level (1-10)
   ```

3. **Run validation:**
   ```bash
   debtmap validate .
   ```

4. **Check exit code:**
   ```bash
   echo $?  # 0 = pass, non-zero = fail
   ```

## Understanding Density-Based Validation

Debtmap uses **density-based metrics** as the primary quality measure. This approach provides several advantages over traditional absolute count metrics.

### Why Density Matters

Traditional metrics like "maximum 50 high-complexity functions" fail as your codebase grows:

```
Scenario: Your team adds 10,000 LOC of high-quality code
- Old metric: "max 50 complex functions" → FAILS (now 55 total)
- Density metric: "max 50 per 1000 LOC" → PASSES (density improved)
```

**Scale-dependent metrics** (absolute counts):
- Grow linearly with codebase size
- Require constant threshold adjustments
- Punish healthy growth
- Don't reflect actual code quality

**Density metrics** (per 1000 LOC):
- Remain stable as codebase grows
- Measure true quality ratios
- No adjustment needed for growth
- Directly comparable across projects

### Calculating Debt Density

```
Debt Density = (Total Debt Items / Total LOC) × 1000
```

**Example:**
- 25 debt items in 5,000 LOC project
- Density = (25 / 5000) × 1000 = **5.0 debt items per 1000 LOC**

This density remains meaningful whether your codebase is 5,000 or 500,000 LOC.

### Recommended Density Thresholds

| Project Type | max_debt_density | Rationale |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| **New/Greenfield** | 20.0 | High quality bar for new code |
| **Active Development** | 50.0 | Balanced quality/velocity (default) |
| **Legacy Modernization** | 100.0 | Prevent regression during refactoring |
| **Mature/Critical** | 30.0 | Maintain quality in stable systems |

## Configuration Setup

### Creating Configuration File

The `debtmap init` command generates a `.debtmap.toml` with sensible defaults:

```bash
debtmap init
```

This creates:
```toml
[thresholds.validation]
# Primary quality metrics (scale-independent)
max_average_complexity = 10.0
max_debt_density = 50.0
max_codebase_risk_score = 7.0

# Optional metrics
min_coverage_percentage = 0.0  # Disabled by default

# Safety net (high ceiling for extreme cases)
max_total_debt_score = 10000
```

### Editing Thresholds

Edit the `[thresholds.validation]` section to match your quality requirements:

```toml
[thresholds.validation]
# Enforce stricter quality for new project
max_debt_density = 30.0              # Tighter density requirement
max_average_complexity = 8.0         # Lower complexity tolerance
max_codebase_risk_score = 6.0        # Reduced risk threshold
min_coverage_percentage = 80.0       # Require 80% test coverage
```

### Override via Command Line

You can override the density threshold from the command line:

```bash
# Temporarily use stricter threshold
debtmap validate . --max-debt-density 40.0
```

## Validation Metrics

Debtmap organizes validation metrics into three categories:

### Primary Metrics (Scale-Independent)

These are the core quality measures that every project should monitor:

1. **`max_average_complexity`** (default: 10.0)
   - Average cyclomatic complexity per function
   - Measures typical function complexity across codebase
   - Lower values indicate simpler, more maintainable code

   ```toml
   max_average_complexity = 10.0
   ```

2. **`max_debt_density`** (default: 50.0) - **PRIMARY METRIC**
   - Debt items per 1000 lines of code
   - Scale-independent quality measure
   - Remains stable as codebase grows

   ```toml
   max_debt_density = 50.0
   ```

3. **`max_codebase_risk_score`** (default: 7.0)
   - Overall risk level combining complexity, coverage, and criticality
   - Score ranges from 1 (low risk) to 10 (high risk)
   - Considers context-aware analysis when enabled

   ```toml
   max_codebase_risk_score = 7.0
   ```

### Optional Metrics

Configure these when you want additional quality enforcement:

4. **`min_coverage_percentage`** (default: 0.0 - disabled)
   - Minimum required test coverage percentage
   - Only enforced when coverage data is provided via `--coverage-file`
   - Set to 0.0 to disable coverage requirements

   ```toml
   min_coverage_percentage = 75.0  # Require 75% coverage
   ```

### Safety Net Metrics

High ceilings to catch extreme cases:

5. **`max_total_debt_score`** (default: 10000)
   - Absolute ceiling on total technical debt
   - Prevents runaway growth even if density stays low
   - Rarely triggers in normal operation

   ```toml
   max_total_debt_score = 10000
   ```

### Metric Priority

When validation fails, fix issues in this order:

1. **Critical:** `max_debt_density` violations (core quality metric)
2. **High:** `max_average_complexity` violations (function-level quality)
3. **High:** `max_codebase_risk_score` violations (overall risk)
4. **Medium:** `min_coverage_percentage` violations (test coverage)
5. **Low:** `max_total_debt_score` violations (extreme cases only)

## Exit Codes and CI Integration

The `validate` command uses exit codes to signal success or failure:

### Exit Code Behavior

```bash
debtmap validate .
echo $?
```

**Exit codes:**
- **`0`** - Success: All thresholds passed
- **Non-zero** - Failure: One or more thresholds exceeded or errors occurred

### Using Exit Codes in CI

Exit codes integrate naturally with CI/CD systems:

**GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
- name: Validate code quality
  run: debtmap validate .
  # Step fails automatically if exit code is non-zero
```

**GitLab CI:**
```yaml
script:
  - debtmap validate .
  # Pipeline fails if exit code is non-zero
```

**Shell scripts:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if debtmap validate .; then
    echo "✅ Validation passed"
else
    echo "❌ Validation failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Understanding Validation Output

**Success output:**
```
✅ Validation PASSED

Metrics:
  Average Complexity: 7.2 / 10.0 ✓
  Debt Density: 32.5 / 50.0 ✓
  Codebase Risk: 5.8 / 7.0 ✓
  Total Debt Score: 1250 / 10000 ✓
```

**Failure output:**
```
❌ Validation FAILED

Metrics:
  Average Complexity: 12.3 / 10.0 ✗ EXCEEDED
  Debt Density: 65.8 / 50.0 ✗ EXCEEDED
  Codebase Risk: 5.2 / 7.0 ✓
  Total Debt Score: 2100 / 10000 ✓

Failed checks: 2
```

## Coverage Integration

Integrate test coverage data to enable risk-based validation:

### Generating Coverage Data

**For Rust projects with `cargo-tarpaulin`:**
```bash
cargo tarpaulin --out Lcov --output-dir target/coverage
```

**For Python projects with `pytest-cov`:**
```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report=lcov:coverage/lcov.info
```

**For JavaScript projects with Jest:**
```bash
jest --coverage --coverageReporters=lcov
```

### Running Validation with Coverage

```bash
debtmap validate . --coverage-file target/coverage/lcov.info
```

### Benefits of Coverage Integration

With coverage data, validation gains additional insights:

1. **Risk-based prioritization** - Identifies untested complex code
2. **Coverage threshold enforcement** - via `min_coverage_percentage`
3. **Enhanced risk scoring** - Combines complexity + coverage + context
4. **Better failure diagnostics** - Shows which untested areas need attention

### Coverage-Enhanced Output

```bash
debtmap validate . --coverage-file coverage/lcov.info -vv
```

Output includes:
- Overall coverage percentage
- High-risk uncovered functions
- Coverage-adjusted risk scores
- Prioritized remediation recommendations

## Context-Aware Validation

Enable context-aware analysis for deeper risk insights:

### Available Context Providers

1. **`critical_path`** - Analyzes call graph to find execution bottlenecks
2. **`dependency`** - Identifies highly-coupled modules
3. **`git_history`** - Detects frequently-changed code (churn)

### Enabling Context Providers

**Enable all providers:**
```bash
debtmap validate . --enable-context
```

**Select specific providers:**
```bash
debtmap validate . --enable-context --context-providers critical_path,git_history
```

**Disable specific providers:**
```bash
debtmap validate . --enable-context --disable-context dependency
```

### Context-Aware Configuration

Add context settings to `.debtmap.toml`:

```toml
[analysis]
enable_context = true
context_providers = ["critical_path", "git_history"]
```

Then run validation:
```bash
debtmap validate .  # Uses config settings
```

### Context Benefits for Validation

Context-aware analysis improves risk scoring by:
- Prioritizing frequently-called functions
- Weighting high-churn code more heavily
- Identifying architectural bottlenecks
- Surfacing critical code paths

## Migrating from Deprecated Thresholds

Debtmap version 0.3.0 deprecated scale-dependent absolute count metrics in favor of density-based metrics.

### Deprecated Metrics

The following metrics will be **removed in v1.0**:

| Deprecated Metric | Migration Path |
|-------------------|----------------|
| `max_high_complexity_count` | Use `max_debt_density` |
| `max_debt_items` | Use `max_debt_density` |
| `max_high_risk_functions` | Use `max_debt_density` + `max_codebase_risk_score` |

### Migration Example

**Old configuration (deprecated):**
```toml
[thresholds.validation]
max_high_complexity_count = 50    # ❌ Scale-dependent
max_debt_items = 100               # ❌ Scale-dependent
max_high_risk_functions = 20       # ❌ Scale-dependent
```

**New configuration (recommended):**
```toml
[thresholds.validation]
max_debt_density = 50.0            # ✅ Scale-independent
max_average_complexity = 10.0      # ✅ Quality ratio
max_codebase_risk_score = 7.0      # ✅ Risk level
```

### Calculating Equivalent Density Threshold

Convert your old absolute thresholds to density:

```
Old: max_debt_items = 100 in 10,000 LOC codebase
New: max_debt_density = (100 / 10000) × 1000 = 10.0
```

### Deprecation Warnings

When you run `validate` with deprecated metrics, you'll see:

```
⚠️  DEPRECATION WARNING:
   The following validation thresholds are deprecated:
   - max_high_complexity_count
   - max_debt_items

   These scale-dependent metrics will be removed in v1.0.
   Please migrate to density-based validation:
     - Use 'max_debt_density' instead of absolute counts
     - Density metrics remain stable as your codebase grows
```

### Migration Timeline

- **v0.3.0** - Density metrics introduced, old metrics deprecated
- **v0.4.0 - v0.9.x** - Deprecation warnings shown
- **v1.0.0** - Deprecated metrics removed

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging Validation Failures

Use verbosity flags to understand why validation failed:

**Level 1: Basic details**
```bash
debtmap validate . -v
```
Shows which thresholds failed and by how much.

**Level 2: Detailed breakdown**
```bash
debtmap validate . -vv
```
Shows score components and top violating functions.

**Level 3: Full diagnostic output**
```bash
debtmap validate . -vvv
```
Shows complete analysis details including all debt items and risk calculations.

### Common Issues

**Issue: Validation fails but output unclear**
```bash
# Solution: Increase verbosity
debtmap validate . -vv
```

**Issue: Want to see only the worst problems**
```bash
# Solution: Use --top flag
debtmap validate . --top 10 -v
```

**Issue: Validation passes locally but fails in CI**
```bash
# Possible causes:
# 1. Different code (stale local branch)
# 2. Different config file (check .debtmap.toml in CI)
# 3. Missing coverage data (check LCOV generation in CI)

# Debug in CI:
debtmap validate . -vvv  # Maximum verbosity
```

**Issue: Coverage threshold fails unexpectedly**
```bash
# Check if coverage file is being read
debtmap validate . --coverage-file coverage/lcov.info -v

# Verify coverage file exists and is valid
ls -lh coverage/lcov.info
```

**Issue: Context providers causing performance issues**
```bash
# Disable expensive providers
debtmap validate . --enable-context --disable-context git_history
```

### Validation Report Generation

Generate detailed reports for debugging:

**JSON format for programmatic analysis:**
```bash
debtmap validate . --format json --output validation-report.json
cat validation-report.json | jq '.validation_details'
```

**Markdown format for documentation:**
```bash
debtmap validate . --format markdown --output validation-report.md
```

**Terminal format with filtering:**
```bash
debtmap validate . --format terminal --top 20 -vv
```

## Best Practices

### Setting Initial Thresholds

**1. Establish baseline:**
```bash
# Run analysis to see current metrics
debtmap analyze . --format json > baseline.json
cat baseline.json | jq '.unified_analysis.debt_density'
```

**2. Set pragmatic thresholds:**
```toml
[thresholds.validation]
# Start slightly above current values to prevent regression
max_debt_density = 60.0  # Current: 55.0
max_average_complexity = 12.0  # Current: 10.5
```

**3. Gradually tighten:**
```toml
# After 1 month of cleanup
max_debt_density = 50.0
max_average_complexity = 10.0
```

### Progressive Threshold Tightening

**Month 1-2: Prevent regression**
```toml
max_debt_density = 60.0  # Above current baseline
```

**Month 3-4: Incremental improvement**
```toml
max_debt_density = 50.0  # Industry standard
```

**Month 5-6: Quality leadership**
```toml
max_debt_density = 30.0  # Best-in-class
```

### Project-Specific Recommendations

**Greenfield projects:**
```toml
# Start with high quality bar
max_debt_density = 20.0
max_average_complexity = 8.0
min_coverage_percentage = 80.0
```

**Active development:**
```toml
# Balanced quality/velocity
max_debt_density = 50.0
max_average_complexity = 10.0
min_coverage_percentage = 70.0
```

**Legacy modernization:**
```toml
# Prevent regression during refactoring
max_debt_density = 100.0
max_average_complexity = 15.0
min_coverage_percentage = 50.0
```

### Pre-Commit Hook Integration

Add validation as a pre-commit hook:

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running debtmap validation..."
if debtmap validate . -v; then
    echo "✅ Validation passed"
    exit 0
else
    echo "❌ Validation failed - commit blocked"
    exit 1
fi
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Performance Optimization

**Enable parallel processing:**
Validation uses parallel processing by default for fast execution on multi-core systems.

**Disable for resource-constrained environments:**
```bash
# Limit parallelism
debtmap validate . --jobs 2

# Disable completely
debtmap validate . --no-parallel
```

**Performance characteristics:**
- Parallel call graph construction
- Multi-threaded file analysis
- Same performance as `analyze` command

### Monitoring Trends

Track validation metrics over time:

```bash
# Generate timestamped reports
debtmap validate . --format json --output "reports/validation-$(date +%Y%m%d).json"

# Compare trends
jq -s 'map(.unified_analysis.debt_density)' reports/validation-*.json
```

### Documentation

Document your threshold decisions:

```toml
# .debtmap.toml
[thresholds.validation]
# Rationale: Team agreed 50.0 density balances quality and velocity
# Review: Quarterly (next: 2025-04-01)
max_debt_density = 50.0

# Rationale: Enforces single-responsibility principle
# Review: After 3 months of metrics
max_average_complexity = 10.0
```

## Summary

The `validate` command provides automated quality gates for CI/CD integration:

- **Use density-based metrics** for scale-independent quality measurement
- **Configure in `.debtmap.toml`** for consistent, version-controlled thresholds
- **Integrate with CI/CD** using exit codes for automated enforcement
- **Enable coverage and context** for risk-based validation
