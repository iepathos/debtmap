# Refactoring Verification Report

## Function: `FunctionPointerVisitor::analyze_function_pointer_assignment`

### Debt Item Analysis (Outdated)
- **Location**: src/analysis/call_graph/function_pointer.rs:315
- **Original Complexity**: Cyclomatic=6, Cognitive=15
- **Recommendation**: Extract nested processing, complex calculations

### Current State (Already Refactored)
The function has already been successfully refactored following best practices:

#### Actual Complexity: ~2
The function now has minimal cyclomatic complexity with only one conditional branch.

#### Refactoring Applied:
1. **Extract Method Pattern** successfully implemented
   - `extract_assignment_data`: Validates and extracts assignment data
   - `build_function_pointer_info`: Constructs the function pointer info

#### Test Coverage:
Comprehensive tests already exist:
- `test_analyze_function_pointer_assignment_complete`
- `test_analyze_function_pointer_assignment_no_init`
- `test_analyze_function_pointer_assignment_non_ident_pattern`
- `test_analyze_function_pointer_assignment_no_current_function`
- `test_extract_assignment_data_valid`
- Additional tests for helper methods

### Conclusion
No further action needed. The debt item appears to be based on outdated analysis. The function has already been refactored to reduce complexity from 6 to ~2 and has comprehensive test coverage.

### Verification
- ✅ All tests pass (`just ci`)
- ✅ No clippy warnings
- ✅ Code follows functional programming patterns
- ✅ Complexity successfully reduced below target
